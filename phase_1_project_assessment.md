# Phase 1: Project Assessment (Day 1-2)

## Overview
Initial assessment phase to understand the current project structure, identify integration points, and create a comprehensive integration plan for Claude Code + Puppeteer.

## Step 1: Analyze Current Project Structure

### 1.1 Project Architecture Review
- [ ] Document current Next.js 15.2.4 architecture
  - [ ] Identify key directories and their purposes
  - [ ] Map out component hierarchy
  - [ ] Document API routes and endpoints
  - [ ] List all environment variables and configurations

### 1.2 Existing Test Infrastructure
- [ ] Analyze current testing setup
  - [ ] Review existing Playwright tests in `__tests__/e2e/`
  - [ ] Document test patterns and conventions
  - [ ] Identify test utilities and helpers
  - [ ] Review page object models

### 1.3 Code Coverage Analysis
- [ ] Measure current test coverage
  - [ ] Unit test coverage
  - [ ] E2E test coverage
  - [ ] Identify untested critical paths
  - [ ] Document areas needing test improvement

### 1.4 Dependencies and Tools
- [ ] Audit current development dependencies
  - [ ] Testing frameworks (Playwright, Vitest)
  - [ ] Build tools and configurations
  - [ ] CI/CD pipeline setup
  - [ ] Development workflow tools

## Step 2: Create Integration Assessment Report

### 2.1 Integration Points Identification
- [ ] Identify Claude Code integration opportunities
  - [ ] Test generation automation points
  - [ ] Code analysis touchpoints
  - [ ] Documentation generation areas
  - [ ] Workflow automation candidates

### 2.2 Puppeteer vs Playwright Analysis
- [ ] Compare Puppeteer benefits for this project
  - [ ] Feature comparison matrix
  - [ ] Performance implications
  - [ ] Migration complexity assessment
  - [ ] ROI analysis for switching/supplementing

### 2.3 Risk Assessment
- [ ] Document potential integration risks
  - [ ] Breaking changes to existing tests
  - [ ] Performance impact concerns
  - [ ] Team learning curve
  - [ ] Maintenance overhead

### 2.4 Resource Requirements
- [ ] Estimate required resources
  - [ ] Developer time allocation
  - [ ] Infrastructure needs
  - [ ] Training requirements
  - [ ] Budget considerations

### 2.5 Integration Roadmap
- [ ] Create detailed integration plan
  - [ ] Priority matrix for features
  - [ ] Timeline with milestones
  - [ ] Success metrics definition
  - [ ] Rollback strategies

## Deliverables
1. **Project Structure Document**: Comprehensive overview of current architecture
2. **Test Coverage Report**: Current state of testing with gap analysis
3. **Integration Assessment Report**: Detailed plan for Claude Code + Puppeteer integration
4. **Risk Mitigation Plan**: Strategies to handle identified risks
5. **Resource Allocation Plan**: Team and infrastructure requirements

## Success Criteria
- Complete understanding of current project state
- Clear identification of integration points
- Stakeholder approval on integration plan
- Defined metrics for measuring integration success
- Team alignment on approach and timeline

## Notes
- Focus on non-disruptive integration approach
- Prioritize high-value, low-risk wins
- Ensure compatibility with existing workflows
- Document all findings thoroughly for future reference
