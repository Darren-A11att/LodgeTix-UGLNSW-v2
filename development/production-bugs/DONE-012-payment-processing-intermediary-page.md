# DONE - Missing Payment Processing Intermediary Page

## Issue Description
After payment submission, users are not shown a proper intermediary page indicating their registration is being processed. The application should display a loading page with progress indicators showing the backend processing steps in a user-friendly manner.

## Current Behavior
- Payment is submitted
- User experiences unclear transition or waiting period
- No visibility into what's happening during processing
- Potential confusion about whether payment was successful

## Expected Behavior
Display an intermediary processing page with:
1. Initial loading animation/GIF
2. Progress indicator using vertical circles (to be replaced with custom SVG icons)
3. Text-based progress updates showing user-friendly processing steps
4. Real-time status updates as backend processes complete

## Visual Requirements
- Use TailwindPlus progress bar component with circles and text
- Reference component: `/development/progressbar-circleswithtext.tsx`
- Replace default circle shapes with custom SVG icons (to be provided)
- Display helpful, user-friendly log messages for each step

## Example Processing Steps to Display
```
✓ Payment received
○ Validating registration details...
○ Reserving tickets...
○ Generating confirmation...
○ Sending email receipt...
```

## User-Friendly Messages Examples
- "Payment received - processing your registration"
- "Securing your tickets for the event"
- "Creating your personalized QR codes"
- "Preparing your confirmation email"
- "Finalizing your registration"

## Technical Implementation
1. Create new intermediary route/page for payment processing
2. Implement progress tracking for backend operations
3. Use WebSocket or polling for real-time status updates
4. Integrate TailwindPlus progress component
5. Add custom SVG icon support
6. Implement graceful error handling with clear messages

## Benefits
- Reduces user anxiety during payment processing
- Provides transparency into system operations
- Prevents users from refreshing or navigating away
- Professional user experience matching modern standards
- Clear feedback if any step fails

## Affected Components
- Payment submission flow
- Registration completion process
- Confirmation page routing
- Backend processing status tracking

## Priority
High - Critical for user experience and reducing support inquiries

## Additional Considerations
- Ensure mobile-responsive design
- Add timeout handling for stuck processes
- Include "Contact Support" option if processing takes too long
- Maintain progress if user refreshes page
- Consider estimated time remaining display

## Success Criteria
- Users understand their payment is being processed
- Clear visibility of each processing step
- Smooth transition to confirmation page
- Reduced support tickets about payment status
- Professional appearance during critical payment flow

## Resolution
