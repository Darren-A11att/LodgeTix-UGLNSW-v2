# Payment Success Not Updating Database Records

## Issue Description
When a payment is successfully completed through Stripe, the registration and ticket statuses are not being updated in Supabase. Despite successful payment events from Stripe, the database records remain in their pre-payment state.

## Evidence from Stripe
Payment successfully processed at 1:56:10 PM on May 24, 2025:
- Payment Intent ID: `pi_3RSIT3KBASow5NsW1eppIDH3`
- Charge ID: `ch_3RSIT3KBASow5NsW12rbKSTu`
- Amount: AUD 1,500.00
- Status: **succeeded**

### Stripe Event Sequence:
1. `payment_intent.created` - 1:50:29 pm
2. `charge.succeeded` - 1:56:10 pm
3. `payment_intent.succeeded` - 1:56:10 pm
4. `charge.updated` - 1:56:13 pm

### Payment Details:
- Customer: Ernie Apprentice (ernie@allatt.me)
- Phone: 0400 123 456
- Card: Visa ending in 4242
- Risk Score: 9 (normal)
- Network Status: approved_by_network

## Expected Database Updates
After successful payment, the following should occur:

### 1. Registration Table Updates
- `payment_status`: Should update to 'paid' or 'completed'
- `payment_intent_id`: Should store Stripe payment intent ID
- `payment_date`: Should record payment timestamp
- `registration_status`: Should update to 'confirmed'

### 2. Ticket Status Updates
- Individual ticket records should be marked as 'paid'
- Ticket allocation should be confirmed
- QR codes should be generated/activated

### 3. Transaction Recording
- Payment transaction should be logged
- Receipt information should be stored
- Stripe charge ID should be recorded

## Current Behavior
- Payment succeeds in Stripe
- Customer is charged successfully
- Database records remain unchanged
- Registration appears unpaid in system
- Tickets remain in pending state

## Critical Impact
- **Financial Risk**: Money collected but services not provisioned
- **Customer Experience**: Paid customers cannot access tickets
- **Reconciliation**: Mismatch between Stripe and database records
- **Support Burden**: Manual intervention required for each payment
- **Event Access**: Attendees may be denied entry despite payment

## Root Cause Analysis
Potential issues:
1. Webhook endpoint not configured or failing
2. Payment verification API not updating database
3. Missing post-payment database update logic
4. Transaction handling not implemented
5. Database permissions preventing updates

## Required Implementation
1. **Webhook Handler**: Implement Stripe webhook to catch payment events
2. **Payment Verification**: Add verification step after payment confirmation
3. **Database Updates**: Implement atomic updates for registration and tickets
4. **Error Handling**: Add logging and rollback for failed updates
5. **Monitoring**: Add alerts for payment/database mismatches

## Verification Steps
1. Check for Stripe webhook configuration
2. Review API logs for post-payment calls
3. Verify database update permissions
4. Check for error logs during payment processing
5. Test payment flow end-to-end

## Priority
**CRITICAL** - Revenue impacting bug requiring immediate fix

## Temporary Workaround
Until fixed, support team must:
1. Monitor Stripe dashboard for successful payments
2. Manually update registration status in database
3. Generate tickets manually
4. Send confirmation emails manually

## Success Criteria
- All successful Stripe payments automatically update database
- Registration and ticket statuses reflect payment state
- Atomic updates ensure data consistency
- Failed updates are logged and alerted
- No manual intervention required for standard payments
