# Package Details Displaying UUIDs Instead of Names

## Issue Description
On the Review Order step, the package details section shows raw UUIDs instead of human-readable package names in the "Package including: ..." text.

## Location
- Review Order Step
- "Tickets for This Attendee" section
- Package details display

## Current Behavior
Package including: [UUID-1], [UUID-2], [UUID-3]

## Expected Behavior
Package including: Welcome Reception, Gala Dinner, Installation Ceremony

## Impact
- Poor user experience
- Confusion about what's included in packages
- Unprofessional appearance
- Users cannot verify their selections

## Root Cause
Likely displaying raw database IDs instead of resolving to package names/titles.

## Affected Components
- Order review display logic
- Package data resolution
- Ticket/package name mapping

## Priority
High - Directly affects user ability to review and confirm orders

## Suggested Fix
- Resolve package UUIDs to their display names
- Ensure proper data joining/lookup when displaying package contents
- Add fallback handling if package names cannot be resolved

## Resolution Summary
Fixed the issue where package details were showing raw UUIDs instead of human-readable ticket names in the order review step.

### Changes Made:
1. Updated order-review-step.tsx: Modified the package description generation to map ticket IDs to their names
2. Added UUID-to-name resolution using the ticketTypesMinimal array 
3. Implemented fallback to show UUID if ticket name cannot be resolved

The fix ensures that:
- Package descriptions show actual ticket names (e.g., "Welcome Reception, Gala Dinner, Installation Ceremony")
- Users can clearly see what's included in their selected packages
- Professional appearance is maintained throughout the order review process
- If a ticket name cannot be resolved, the UUID is shown as a fallback

Example output after fix:
"Package including: Installation Ceremony, Grand Banquet, Farewell Brunch, City Tour"
