# Issue: Content Tables May Be Missing

**Status:** ðŸŸ¡ YELLOW  
**Severity:** Low  
**Category:** Database Schema

## Problem Description
Build errors suggest content tables might be missing, though a migration exists to create them. The application has safeguards to handle missing tables gracefully.

## Evidence
- Migration exists: `20250125_create_content_tables.sql`
- Recent commit a79d6ce: "fix: handle missing content tables gracefully during build"
- Tables created: `content`, `content_features`, `content_values`

## Impact
- About page may show fallback content instead of database content
- No critical functionality affected
- Build warnings but no failures

## Root Cause
The migration may not have been run in all environments, or there could be a timing issue during build where the database isn't accessible.

## Fix Plan

### Immediate Action
1. Verify if content tables exist in production:
   ```sql
   SELECT EXISTS (
     SELECT FROM information_schema.tables 
     WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
     AND table_name = 'content'
   );
   ```
2. If missing, run the migration manually

### Long-term Solution
1. Ensure migrations run before deployment
2. Add health check endpoint that verifies all required tables
3. Consider moving content to static files if database access during build is problematic
4. Add migration status tracking

## Verification Steps
```bash
# Check if content is loading properly
curl https://yourdomain.com/about

# Check for console errors about missing tables
# Look for fallback content being displayed
```
