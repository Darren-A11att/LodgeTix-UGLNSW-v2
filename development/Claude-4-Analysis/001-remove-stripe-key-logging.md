# Task 001: Remove Stripe Key Logging

**Priority**: Critical  
**Category**: Security  
**Dependencies**: None  
**Estimated Time**: 15 minutes  

## Problem

The Stripe secret key is being logged to console in production code, which is a critical security vulnerability. This exposes sensitive API credentials in application logs.

**Location**: `app/api/stripe/create-payment-intent/route.ts:17`

```typescript
console.log("STRIPE_SECRET_KEY (first 10 chars):", stripeSecretKey.substring(0, 10) + "...");
```

## Solution

Remove all console.log statements that output any part of the Stripe secret key, even partial values.

## Implementation Steps

1. Open `app/api/stripe/create-payment-intent/route.ts`
2. Remove line 17 that logs the Stripe key
3. Search entire codebase for any other instances of Stripe key logging:
   ```bash
   grep -r "STRIPE_SECRET_KEY" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" --include="*.js"
   ```
4. Remove any found instances

## Verification

1. Run the application in development mode
2. Check browser console and server logs for any Stripe key output
3. Verify payment flow still works correctly
4. Check that error cases don't inadvertently log the key

## Code Changes

```diff
- console.log("STRIPE_SECRET_KEY (first 10 chars):", stripeSecretKey.substring(0, 10) + "...");
```

## Security Impact

- **Before**: Stripe API key partially exposed in logs
- **After**: No sensitive API credentials in logs
- **Risk Mitigation**: Prevents potential API key theft from log files

## Notes

- After removing the log, rotate the Stripe API key as a precaution
- Consider implementing secure key validation that doesn't involve logging
- Add this to security checklist for code reviews
