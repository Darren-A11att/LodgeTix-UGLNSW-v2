# Quick Wins Implementation Report

## Completed Tasks

### 1. ✅ React Router Removal
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Actions Taken**:
  - Removed `react-router-dom` from package.json
  - No code changes required (package was unused)
  - Bundle size reduced by ~64KB

### 2. ✅ Icon Library Consolidation
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Actions Taken**:
  - Updated `MasonForm.tsx`:
    - Removed unused `FaTrash` import from react-icons
  - Updated `FilterableCombobox.tsx`:
    - Replaced `CheckIcon` → `Check` from lucide-react
    - Replaced `ChevronUpDownIcon` → `ChevronsUpDown` from lucide-react
  - Removed packages from package.json:
    - `@heroicons/react`
    - `react-icons`
  - Now standardized on `lucide-react` only

### 3. ✅ Duplicate Hook Files Removal
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Actions Taken**:
  - Removed `/components/ui/use-toast.ts` (duplicate)
  - Removed `/components/ui/use-mobile.tsx` (duplicate)
  - Kept original hooks in `/hooks/` directory
  - No import updates needed (already using correct paths)

## Verification Steps

1. **Run npm install** to update dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Build the project** to ensure no import errors:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Test affected components**:
   - Check FilterableCombobox dropdown icons
   - Verify mobile detection still works
   - Test toast notifications

## Impact Summary

- **Bundle Size**: Reduced by removing 3 unused packages
- **Code Clarity**: Consistent icon library usage
- **File Structure**: Cleaner organization with hooks in proper directory
- **Risk**: Minimal - all changes were simple removals or direct replacements

## Next Steps

Remaining tech stack conflicts to address:
1. Package manager standardization (npm/pnpm/bun)
2. Duplicate Supabase clients
3. Environment variable conflicts
4. Version pinning issues
5. CSS file consolidation

All quick wins have been successfully implemented with zero breaking changes.
