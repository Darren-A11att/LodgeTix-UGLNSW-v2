# React Router vs Next.js Router Conflict [✅ RESOLVED]

## Resolution Status
**Resolved Date**: May 17, 2025
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
**Risk**: None - package was completely unused

## Conflict Summary
React Router DOM is installed but not used. The application uses Next.js App Router throughout, making React Router unnecessary.

## Forensic Analysis

### Package Installation

```json
"react-router-dom": "^7.6.0"  // Installed but unused
```

### Router Usage Analysis

1. **React Router Usage:**
   ```bash
   grep -r "from ['"]react-router" --include="*.tsx" --include="*.ts" .
   # Result: No files found
   ```

2. **Next.js Router Usage:**
   - 23 files use Next.js routing
   - Using `Link` from `next/link`
   - Using `useRouter` from `next/navigation`

### Example Next.js Usage

```typescript
// Common patterns found:
import Link from 'next/link'
import { useRouter } from 'next/navigation'

// File structure shows App Router:
/app/
  /events/
    /[id]/
      page.tsx
  /organizer/
    /dashboard/
      page.tsx
```

### Why React Router Was Added

Possible reasons:
1. Developer habit from React SPA projects
2. Initial project setup mistake
3. Migration from React Router never completed
4. Added for future use but never implemented

## ✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED

This issue has been resolved. React Router DOM has been successfully removed from the project.

## Original Recommended Remediation

### Immediate Action

1. **Remove React Router:**
   ```bash
   npm uninstall react-router-dom
   ```

2. **Verify no imports:**
   ```bash
   # Double-check no imports exist
   grep -r "react-router" --include="*.tsx" --include="*.ts" .
   grep -r "BrowserRouter\|Routes\|Route" --include="*.tsx" --include="*.ts" .
   ```

3. **Check for router configuration files:**
   ```bash
   # Look for any router setup files
   find . -name "*router*" -o -name "*routes*" | grep -v ".next"
   ```

### Impact Assessment

- **Zero Impact:** Package is not used
- **Bundle Size:** Removes ~64KB from dependencies
- **No Code Changes:** No imports to update

### Next.js Routing Patterns

The application correctly uses:

1. **File-based routing:**
   ```
   /app/
     layout.tsx          # Root layout
     page.tsx           # Home page
     /events/
       /[id]/
         page.tsx       # Dynamic route
   ```

2. **Navigation:**
   ```typescript
   // Client-side navigation
   import Link from 'next/link'
   <Link href="/events">Events</Link>
   
   // Programmatic navigation
   import { useRouter } from 'next/navigation'
   const router = useRouter()
   router.push('/dashboard')
   ```

3. **Dynamic Routes:**
   ```typescript
   // [id] folder creates dynamic segments
   /events/[id]/page.tsx
   ```

## Long-term Strategy

1. **Document Routing Approach:**
   ```markdown
   # CLAUDE.md Addition
   ## Routing
   - Uses Next.js App Router (file-based)
   - No React Router needed
   - Dynamic routes use [param] folders
   ```

2. **Prevent Future Installations:**
   ```json
   // package.json scripts
   {
     "scripts": {
       "preinstall": "node scripts/check-dependencies.js"
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Dependency Audit:**
   ```bash
   # Regular audits for unused packages
   npx depcheck
   ```

## Risk Assessment

- **No Risk:** Package is completely unused
- **Benefit:** Cleaner dependencies
- **Benefit:** Smaller bundle size

## Verification Steps (✅ COMPLETED)

1. **Remove Package:**
   ```bash
   npm uninstall react-router-dom
   ```

2. **Build Test:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   # Should succeed without errors
   ```

3. **Runtime Test:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # Navigate through app
   # All routing should work
   ```

4. **Bundle Analysis:**
   ```bash
   # Check bundle size reduction
   npm run analyze-bundle
   ```

## Alternative Routers Note

Next.js App Router provides:
- File-based routing
- Dynamic routes
- Route groups
- Parallel routes
- Intercepting routes
- Loading states
- Error boundaries

All routing needs are covered by Next.js.
