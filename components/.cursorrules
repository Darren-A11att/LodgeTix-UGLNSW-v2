# Components Directory Rules

## Client vs Server Components
- Server components by default
- Use "use client" only for:
  - Event handlers (onClick, onChange)
  - Browser APIs (window, document)
  - React hooks (useState, useEffect)
  - Third-party client libraries

## Component Structure
```
components/
  ui/              # Primitive UI components
  forms/           # Form components
  layouts/         # Layout components
  features/        # Feature-specific components
```

## Best Practices
- Extract client interactivity to leaf components
- Keep components focused and single-purpose
- Use composition over complex props
- Implement proper TypeScript interfaces
- Test components in isolation
