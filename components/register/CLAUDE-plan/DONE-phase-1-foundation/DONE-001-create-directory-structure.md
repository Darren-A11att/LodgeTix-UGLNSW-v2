# Task 001: Create Directory Structure

## Objective
Create the new directory structure as defined in CLAUDE.md to organize the refactored components.

## Dependencies
- None (this is the first task)

## Steps

1. Create the main directories:
```bash
mkdir -p components/register/forms/attendee
mkdir -p components/register/forms/attendee/lib
mkdir -p components/register/forms/attendee/utils
mkdir -p components/register/forms/basic-details
mkdir -p components/register/forms/guest/layouts
mkdir -p components/register/forms/guest/lib
mkdir -p components/register/forms/mason/layouts
mkdir -p components/register/forms/mason/lib
mkdir -p components/register/forms/mason/utils
mkdir -p components/register/forms/shared
```

2. Verify the structure matches CLAUDE.md specification

## Deliverables
- Complete directory structure ready for new components
- No files moved yet (that comes later)

## Success Criteria
- All directories exist as specified
- Structure matches the architecture diagram in CLAUDE.md
