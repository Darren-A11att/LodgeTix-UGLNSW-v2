# Phase 4: Form Compositions - COMPLETE

## Implementation Status: ✅ COMPLETE

All Phase 4 tasks have been successfully completed according to CLAUDE.md requirements.

## Implemented Components

### 1. MasonForm
- **Location**: `/components/register/Forms/Mason/Layouts/MasonForm.tsx`
- **Type**: Pure composition component
- **Sections Composed**:
  - BasicInfo (type="Mason")
  - GrandOfficerFields (conditional on rank === 'GL')
  - GrandLodgeSelection
  - LodgeSelection
  - ContactInfo
  - AdditionalInfo

### 2. GuestForm
- **Location**: `/components/register/Forms/Guest/Layouts/GuestForm.tsx`
- **Type**: Pure composition component
- **Sections Composed**:
  - BasicInfo (type="Guest")
  - ContactInfo
  - AdditionalInfo

## Key Architecture Decisions

1. **Pure Composition**: Forms contain no business logic, only compose sections
2. **Type-based Behavior**: BasicInfo adapts based on type="Mason" or type="Guest"
3. **Conditional Rendering**: GrandOfficerFields only shown for GL rank
4. **State Management**: All state handled by useAttendeeData hook
5. **Loading States**: Simple animated loading placeholders

## Validation & Persistence

Per CLAUDE.md requirements, validation and persistence are handled by:
- Phase 1 utilities already implemented
- useAttendeeData hook manages state
- Container components (Phase 5) will handle context-specific validation
- No custom validation or persistence implementations needed

## Code Quality

- ✅ TypeScript interfaces properly typed
- ✅ Import paths corrected for proper casing
- ✅ No over-engineering or unnecessary variants
- ✅ Follows single responsibility principle
- ✅ Uses existing Phase 1-3 components

## Tasks Completed

1. ✅ DONE-071-create-mason-form.md
2. ✅ DONE-072-create-guest-form.md
3. ✅ DONE-073-create-form-validation.md (using existing utilities)
4. ✅ DONE-074-create-form-persistence.md (using existing utilities)

## Next Phase

Phase 5: Container Layouts
- Implement AttendeeWithPartner container
- Handle partner relationships and toggling
- Orchestrate form rendering based on attendee type
