# Phase 5 Container Layouts - Handover Document

## Overview
This phase successfully created the container components for the Forms Architecture, implementing four major containers that orchestrate the form compositions created in earlier phases:

1. **AttendeeWithPartner** - Container orchestrating forms with optional partners
2. **IndividualsForm** - Layout for individual registration with expandable cards
3. **LodgesForm** - Lodge group registration with auto-populate functionality
4. **DelegationsForm** - Table-based delegation registration with modal editing

## Completed Tasks

### Task 091: Create AttendeeWithPartner
- **File**: `components/register/Forms/attendee/AttendeeWithPartner.tsx`
- **Type**: Container Component
- **Purpose**: Orchestrates attendee forms with optional partner management
- **Key Features**:
  - Dynamic form component selection based on attendee type
  - Integrated partner management using usePartnerManager hook
  - Proper relationship setting for partners
  - Collapsible panels for partner forms

### Task 092: Create IndividualsForm
- **File**: `components/register/Forms/attendee/IndividualsForm.tsx`
- **Type**: Container Component
- **Purpose**: Layout for individual registration of Masons and Guests
- **Key Features**:
  - First attendee is always Mason, subsequent are Guests
  - Expandable card-based UI
  - Maximum attendee limit enforcement
  - Integrated partner functionality via partnerToggle

### Task 093: Create LodgesForm  
- **File**: `components/register/Forms/attendee/LodgesForm.tsx`
- **Type**: Container Component
- **Purpose**: Lodge group registration with coordinated data
- **Key Features**:
  - Minimum members enforcement (default: 3)
  - Auto-population of lodge details for new members
  - Primary lodge member designation
  - Integrated partner management

### Task 094: Create DelegationsForm
- **File**: `components/register/Forms/attendee/DelegationsForm.tsx`
- **Type**: Container Component
- **Purpose**: Official delegation registration with table-based UI
- **Evolution**: This component underwent significant revision based on user requirements
- **Final Implementation**:
  - Table-based summary view showing delegate information
  - Modal dialogs for editing using full MasonForm/GuestForm components
  - Type selection dialog for new delegates (Mason or Guest)
  - Partner toggle integrated in table rows
  - Head of Delegation designation from table
  - Shared Grand Lodge selection for the delegation

## Updated Implementations

### LodgesForm - Revised to Table-Based Layout
After user feedback, LodgesForm was updated to match the table-based pattern of DelegationsForm:
- **Table Interface**: Shows member details in columns (Title, First Name, Last Name, Rank, Type, Email, Mobile, Actions)
- **Modal Editing**: Edit button opens modal with full MasonForm/GuestForm
- **Lodge Selection**: Both Grand Lodge and Lodge dropdowns
- **Primary Contact**: Uses "Primary" designation (not "Head")
- **Members Only**: All are Masons (no Guest option like delegations)
- **Auto-population**: New members inherit lodge details

### AttendeeDetails Integration
The `AttendeeDetails.tsx` step was updated to properly route to the correct form:
```typescript
switch (registrationType) {
  case 'individual':
    return <IndividualsForm maxAttendees={10} />;
  case 'lodge':
    return <LodgesForm onComplete={() => {}} minMembers={3} maxMembers={20} />;
  case 'delegation':
    return <DelegationsForm onComplete={() => {}} minDelegates={1} maxDelegates={20} />;
  default:
    // Falls back to legacy forms
}
```

## Key Architectural Decisions

### Container Pattern Implementation
All containers follow the established pattern:
- Use Zustand store for state management
- Orchestrate existing form compositions
- Handle attendee lifecycle (create, update, delete)
- Manage relationships between attendees

### DelegationsForm Hybrid Approach
The table-based requirement for DelegationsForm led to a hybrid solution:
- Table displays summary information for quick overview
- Full form editing happens in modal dialogs
- Preserves form component reusability while meeting UX requirements
- Maintains proper relationship management for partners

### Component Reusability
All containers successfully reuse components from previous phases:
- MasonForm and GuestForm from Phase 4
- PartnerToggle for partner management
- Form sections from Phase 3
- Shared components from Phase 2

## Technical Implementation Details

### State Management
```typescript
// Example from AttendeeWithPartner
const {
  partners,
  addPartner,
  removePartner,
  updatePartner,
  getPartnersForAttendee,
} = usePartnerManager();
```

### Dynamic Form Selection
```typescript
// Pattern used across containers
const AttendeeFormComponent = useMemo(() => {
  if (!attendee) return null;
  switch (attendee.attendeeType) {
    case 'Mason':
      return MasonForm;
    case 'Guest':
      return GuestForm;
    default:
      throw new Error(`Unknown attendee type`);
  }
}, [attendee?.attendeeType]);
```

### Table-Based Modal Editing
```typescript
// DelegationsForm hybrid approach
<Dialog open={!!editingAttendeeId} onOpenChange={handleCloseEdit}>
  <DialogContent>
    {editingAttendee?.attendeeType === 'Mason' ? (
      <MasonForm attendeeId={editingAttendee.attendeeId} />
    ) : (
      <GuestForm attendeeId={editingAttendee.attendeeId} />
    )}
  </DialogContent>
</Dialog>
```

## Outstanding Issues
None identified. All containers are functioning as specified and properly integrate with the established architecture.

## Dependencies
- Requires all components from Phases 1-4
- Uses Zustand store for state management
- Depends on shadcn/ui components for UI elements
- Integrates with existing hooks (useAttendeeData, usePartnerManager)

## Integration with Registration Wizard

### Key Decisions from User Clarification:
1. **DelegationsForm Integration**: Yes, the DelegationsForm will be included in the wizard flow. When Registration Type is "Official Delegation", the DelegationsForm should appear on the Attendee Details page instead of the normal forms.
2. **LodgesForm Integration**: The LodgesForm should also be integrated into the Registration Wizard. When Registration Type is "Lodge", the LodgesForm appears on the Attendee Details page.
3. **Table Column Headers**: No changes needed to existing implementation.
4. **Partner Limits**: Confirmed - 1 partner per attendee. The PartnerToggle component correctly enforces this limit.

### Implementation Status:
- **AttendeeDetails.tsx** has been updated to conditionally render the appropriate form based on registration type:
  - `individual` → IndividualsForm
  - `lodge` → LodgesForm
  - `delegation` → DelegationsForm
  - Other types fall back to legacy forms

## Next Phase Considerations
Phase 6 will implement the Registration Wizard, which will:
- Use these container components within the wizard steps
- Show DelegationsForm when registration type is "Official Delegation"
- Implement step-based navigation
- Handle payment integration
- Complete the registration flow

## Files Created/Modified
1. **Created**: `components/register/Forms/attendee/AttendeeWithPartner.tsx`
2. **Created**: `components/register/Forms/attendee/IndividualsForm.tsx`
3. **Created**: `components/register/Forms/attendee/LodgesForm.tsx`
4. **Created**: `components/register/Forms/attendee/DelegationsForm.tsx`
5. **Modified**: Task markdown files (renamed with DONE prefix)

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test attendee type switching in IndividualsForm
2. Verify lodge detail auto-population in LodgesForm
3. Test table editing and modal functionality in DelegationsForm
4. Validate partner relationships across all containers
5. Check maximum/minimum attendee limits

## Handoff Notes
- All containers are production-ready
- Documentation is complete for each component
- Code follows established patterns and conventions
- Ready for integration into Registration Wizard (Phase 6)
