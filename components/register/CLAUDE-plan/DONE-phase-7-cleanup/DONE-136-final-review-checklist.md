## Verification Scripts

### 1. Check for old imports:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Checking for old imports..."
grep -r "oldforms" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" . || echo "✓ No oldforms imports"
grep -r "register/functions" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" . || echo "✓ No old function imports"
grep -r "Form2" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" . || echo "✓ No Form2 references"
```

### 2. Run all tests:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Running all tests..."
npm run test:forms -- --coverage
npm run test:e2e
```

### 3. Check bundle size:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Analyzing bundle size..."
npm run build
npm run analyze
```

### 4. Lint check:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Running linters..."
npm run lint
npm run type-check
```

## Sign-off Criteria

### Technical Lead Review
- [ ] Code quality meets standards
- [ ] Architecture is sound
- [ ] Performance is acceptable
- [ ] Tests provide good coverage

## Post-Deployment Tasks

1. Monitor error rates
2. Track performance metrics
3. Gather user feedback
4. Plan iterations
5. Update documentation

## Rollback Plan

If issues are discovered post-deployment:

1. Revert to previous version
2. Restore old forms from backup
3. Update imports back to old paths
4. Investigate and fix issues
5. Re-deploy with fixes

## Success Metrics

- Zero regression bugs
- Improved load times
- Positive user feedback
- Reduced maintenance burden
- Easier feature additions

## Final Notes

This refactoring represents a significant improvement in:
- Code organization
- Type safety
- Reusability
- Maintainability
- Performance

All future form development should follow the patterns established in this architecture.
