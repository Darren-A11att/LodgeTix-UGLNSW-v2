# Updating Event Utils for Supabase Schema Alignment

## Changes Implemented

1. **Enhanced Event Interface**:
   - Expanded the Event interface to match all fields from EventType in shared/types/event.ts
   - Added new fields from Supabase schema (is_published, location_json, etc.)
   - Made interface compatible with both old and new data structures
   - Added detailed field comments to clarify purpose and data type

2. **Improved Mock Data Structure**:
   - Thoroughly restructured all mock events to match Supabase schema
   - Added eventStart/eventEnd ISO timestamps alongside legacy date/time strings
   - Organized mock data into logical sections (core fields, dates, location, etc.)
   - Added realistic structured data for sections, location_json, etc.

3. **Enhanced Data Completeness**:
   - Added previously missing fields like latitude/longitude, organizer_contact
   - Provided detailed structured content (agenda, schedule, eligibility requirements)
   - Added realistic content arrays (importantInformation, eventIncludes)
   - Included both singular and related events

4. **Better Functions and Utilities**:
   - Added input validation to getEventByIdOrSlug and getEventsByCategory
   - Improved formatCurrency to handle missing values and support different currencies
   - Added convertToISODate utility function for date standardization
   - Enhanced filter logic in getEventsByCategory to use both category and type

5. **Documentation and Structure**:
   - Added comprehensive comments throughout the file
   - Organized mock data into well-structured, logical sections
   - Used consistent formatting and naming conventions
   - Made sure all IDs are proper UUIDs

## Decision Points

1. **Dual-Format Approach**:
   - Maintained both legacy formats (date/time) and new formats (eventStart/eventEnd)
   - Added aliased fields (imageUrl/imageSrc, organizer/organizer_name)
   - Ensured data works with both old and new components

2. **Rich Structured Data**:
   - Added detailed sections with realistic structured content
   - Included multiple day schedules for multi-day events
   - Added proper coordinates and location details

3. **Type Safety**:
   - Made Event interface extend Partial<EventType> for better type compatibility
   - Added proper typing for all fields
   - Added defensive checks to functions

4. **UUID Strategy**:
   - Used consistent UUID format for all IDs
   - Added unique UUIDs for all tickets
   - Maintained backward compatibility with legacyIdToEventMapping

## Future Work

1. **Schema Testing**:
   - Verify the new schema against actual database queries
   - Test with all UI components to ensure compatibility

2. **Data Migration**:
   - Consider adding functions to help migrate from mock to real data
   - Test serialization/deserialization of complex objects

3. **Additional Mock Events**:
   - Consider adding more diverse event types (virtual events, educational series)
   - Add examples of nested or recurring events

The enhanced mock data now provides a realistic representation of the Supabase schema while maintaining backward compatibility with existing components. The unified interface ensures seamless transitions between mock and database data sources.
