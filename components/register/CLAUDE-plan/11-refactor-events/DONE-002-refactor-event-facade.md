# Refactoring Event Facade for Better Supabase Integration

## Changes Implemented

1. **Added Memory Caching**:
   - Implemented a simple in-memory cache system for event data
   - Each cache entry includes data and timestamp
   - Added cache TTL (5 minutes) for automatic expiration
   - Cache keys are organized by data type (all events, event by ID, featured events, etc.)

2. **Enhanced Error Handling**:
   - Added input validation and sanitization
   - More specific error messages
   - Better fallback behavior when Supabase is unavailable
   - Try/catch blocks with proper error logging

3. **Improved Logging**:
   - Updated `api-logger.ts` to add structured logging capabilities
   - Added log levels (error, warn, info, debug)
   - Created centralized logging API with consistent formatting
   - Made log level configurable via environment variable

4. **Added Cache Management Functions**:
   - `clearEventCache()` - Clear all cached data
   - `clearEventCacheById(idOrSlug)` - Clear specific event from cache
   - Cache bypass parameter for all functions when fresh data is needed

5. **Enhanced Date/Time Formatting**:
   - Added error handling for date/time formatting functions
   - Better type checking to prevent format errors
   - Fallback behavior for malformed dates

## Decision Points

1. **Cache Strategy**:
   - Decided on in-memory cache with TTL for simplicity
   - Could be replaced with a more sophisticated solution in the future
   - Cache is keyed by function parameters for efficient retrieval

2. **Error Handling Strategy**:
   - Implemented graceful degradation by falling back to hard-coded data
   - Added detailed logging to help with debugging
   - Maintained backward compatibility with existing code

3. **Log Level System**:
   - Created configurable log levels (0-4) to control verbosity
   - Default level set to 3 (info) for production balance
   - Error logs always appear, debug logs only in development

## Future Work

1. **Persistence Layer**:
   - The current cache is in-memory only and doesn't persist across page refreshes
   - Could be extended to use localStorage or IndexedDB for persistence

2. **Cache Invalidation**:
   - Consider adding automatic cache invalidation for related items
   - Implement smarter cache management for collaborative environments

3. **Metrics Collection**:
   - Add performance tracking for database calls vs. cached calls
   - Monitor cache hit rates and optimize accordingly
