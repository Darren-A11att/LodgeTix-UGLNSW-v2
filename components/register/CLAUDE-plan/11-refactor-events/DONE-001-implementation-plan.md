# Event Integration Implementation Plan

## Current State Analysis

Based on our documentation and code review, we've identified:

1. The application currently uses a hybrid approach with a feature flag (`USE_EVENTS_SCHEMA`) controlling data source
2. When `USE_EVENTS_SCHEMA=true`, data comes from Supabase via `events-schema-service.ts`
3. Otherwise, data comes from hard-coded mock data in `event-utils.ts`
4. The event-facade pattern in `event-facade.ts` provides a consistent interface for both sources
5. Some event pages are statically generated, others are server components, and some are client components

## Goals

1. Improve Supabase integration reliability and error handling
2. Align mock data structure with Supabase schema for seamless transitions
3. Add caching to improve performance
4. Create a clear migration path from mock data to Supabase
5. Maintain compatibility with existing pages

## Sequential Implementation Tasks

### 1. Refactor `event-facade.ts`

- Improve error handling with more specific error messages
- Add caching for frequently accessed data
- Ensure consistent data format returned regardless of source
- Add logging for better debugging

### 2. Refactor `events-schema-service.ts`

- Add more robust error handling
- Improve data transformation between DB schema and application schema
- Add data validation to catch schema mismatches early
- Handle edge cases like missing or malformed data

### 3. Update `event-utils.ts` Mock Data

- Align mock data structure with Supabase schema
- Ensure all properties used in the UI are represented in mock data
- Add more realistic test data for development

### 4. Implement Cache Management

- Add memory cache for event data to reduce database calls
- Implement cache invalidation strategy
- Add cache bypass options for when fresh data is required

### 5. Create Migration Plan

- Define steps for transitioning from mock to Supabase
- Create validation tools to compare data consistency
- Define fallback strategies if Supabase is unavailable

## Risk Assessment

Potential issues we should address:

1. **Data Format Mismatches**: Ensure consistent formatting of dates, prices, and URLs
2. **Error Handling**: Improve error handling, especially for network issues
3. **Performance**: Monitor performance impact of switching to database-driven approach
4. **Schema Changes**: Handle schema evolution without breaking the UI
5. **SSG vs SSR**: Ensure static generation still works with database sources

## Acceptance Criteria

For each task:

1. Code changes successfully implemented
2. Tests pass
3. Documentation updated
4. No regressions in existing functionality
5. Feature flag still works as expected

Let's begin with refactoring the `event-facade.ts` file to improve the integration with Supabase while maintaining backward compatibility.
