# Task: Test and Finalize Layout Refactoring

## Description
Perform thorough testing of the refactored registration wizard layout on different devices and browsers. Make any final adjustments and ensure all expected functionality is working correctly.

## Steps
1. Test the entire wizard flow on various device sizes
2. Verify all layouts render correctly on mobile, tablet, and desktop
3. Ensure navigation between steps works properly
4. Validate that form submissions function correctly
5. Check for any visual regressions or layout issues
6. Finalize and document any additional adjustments needed

## Testing Checklist

### General Layout Testing
- [ ] Header, body, and footer are always in view
- [ ] Body content scrolls properly when content exceeds available space
- [ ] No overall page scrolling occurs (only content within the body scrolls)
- [ ] Height is constrained to 100dvh on all devices
- [ ] All components use the correct layout pattern (one-column or two-column)

### Mobile Testing
- [ ] Test on various mobile device sizes (small, medium, large)
- [ ] Verify the TwoColumnStepLayout correctly hides the summary on mobile
- [ ] Confirm the collapsible summary in TwoColumnStepLayout works properly
- [ ] Check that touch targets are sufficiently large (at least 44x44px)
- [ ] Ensure text is readable without zooming
- [ ] Test with both portrait and landscape orientations

### Desktop Testing
- [ ] Verify the two-column layout shows proper proportions (70/30 split)
- [ ] Confirm the sticky summary sidebar works correctly when scrolling
- [ ] Check that form controls have appropriate spacing
- [ ] Ensure all UI elements are accessible via keyboard navigation

### Browser Testing
- [ ] Test on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
- [ ] Verify height calculations work correctly across browsers
- [ ] Check for any browser-specific styling issues
- [ ] Test with different browser zoom levels

### Functional Testing
- [ ] Complete a full registration flow from start to finish
- [ ] Validate all form submissions and state transitions
- [ ] Confirm validation works properly on all steps
- [ ] Test error states and recovery
- [ ] Ensure data persistence works correctly between steps

## Final Adjustments

After testing, the following adjustments may be needed:

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Ensure lazy loading is implemented correctly
   - Verify component memoization where appropriate
   - Check for any unnecessary re-renders

2. **Accessibility Improvements**
   - Verify proper focus management between steps
   - Ensure all interactive elements have appropriate ARIA attributes
   - Test with screen readers and keyboard navigation

3. **Visual Refinements**
   - Adjust spacing and alignments as needed
   - Ensure consistent visual styling across all steps
   - Fix any visual glitches or layout shifts

## Documentation

Once testing is complete, document:
1. The overall layout architecture
2. How to add new steps to the wizard
3. How to modify existing steps
4. Best practices for maintaining the layout system

This documentation should be added to a README.md file in the `components/register/RegistrationWizard/Layouts` directory.
