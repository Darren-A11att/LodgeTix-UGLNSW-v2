# Task: Create Layout Directory Structure

## Description
Create the necessary directory structure for the refactored layout components.

## Steps
1. Create a new directory `Layouts` under `components/register/RegistrationWizard/`
2. Update any imports in existing files that might reference the new path

## Implementation

```bash
# Create the Layouts directory
mkdir -p components/register/RegistrationWizard/Layouts
```

## Directory Structure After Completion
```
components/
  register/
    RegistrationWizard/
      Layouts/
        # Layout components will be placed here
      Shared/
        # Existing shared components
      Steps/
        # Existing step components
      registration-wizard.tsx
      # Other existing files
```

## Rationale
Separating layout concerns from content will improve maintainability and make future changes easier. The Layouts directory will house components that are responsible for structuring the wizard UI without being concerned with the specific content of each step.

## Status
âœ… Completed: Directory structure created successfully
