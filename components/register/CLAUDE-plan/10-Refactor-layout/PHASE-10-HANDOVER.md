# Phase 10: Layout Refactoring Handover (COMPLETED)

## Overview
This phase has successfully refactored the registration wizard's layout structure to achieve consistent height-constrained behavior (100dvh), improved mobile responsiveness, and clearer separation of layout and content concerns.

## Key Objectives Completed
1. ✅ **Fixed Height Layout**: Created a layout system that ensures the wizard always fits within the viewport height (100dvh)
2. ✅ **Centralized Navigation**: Moved navigation controls to a consistent location across all steps
3. ✅ **Responsive Patterns**: Implemented mobile-first design patterns with appropriate desktop adaptations
4. ✅ **Layout Abstraction**: Separated layout concerns from content components
5. ✅ **Documentation**: Created comprehensive documentation for the new layout system

## Architecture Overview
The implemented layout consists of a nested component hierarchy:

```
WizardShellLayout (100dvh container)
└── WizardBodyStructureLayout (4-row structure)
    ├── Row 1: Step Indicator
    ├── Row 2: Section Header
    ├── Row 3: Step Container (OneColumnStepLayout or TwoColumnStepLayout)
    │   └── Step Content Components
    └── Row 4: Navigation Buttons
```

## Key Files Created/Modified

### New Layout Components Created
- ✅ `components/register/RegistrationWizard/Layouts/WizardShellLayout.tsx`
- ✅ `components/register/RegistrationWizard/Layouts/WizardBodyStructureLayout.tsx`
- ✅ `components/register/RegistrationWizard/Layouts/OneColumnStepLayout.tsx`
- ✅ `components/register/RegistrationWizard/Layouts/TwoColumnStepLayout.tsx`

## Next Steps
To complete the refactoring of the registration wizard layout:

1. Refactor the remaining step components:
   - Attendee Details step (Task 9)
   - Ticket Selection, Order Review, Payment, and Confirmation steps (Task 10)

2. Perform comprehensive testing of the refactored layout (Task 11)

3. Add appropriate CSS to ensure height settings are properly applied globally

## Benefits Achieved

2. ✅ **Consistent Navigation**: Navigation buttons are always in the same position
3. ✅ **Maintainable Structure**: Clear separation of layout and content concerns
4. ✅ **Reduced Duplication**: Layout patterns are defined once and reused
5. ✅ **Better Responsiveness**: Proper handling of different screen sizes
6. ✅ **Developer Experience**: Clearer component responsibilities and documentation
