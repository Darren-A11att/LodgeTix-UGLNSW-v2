# Mobile UX Enhancement Handover

## Overview
This document details the implementation of mobile-specific UX enhancements for the registration flow, specifically focusing on the Registration Type selection page. The changes improve usability on mobile devices while maintaining the desktop experience.

## Completed Enhancements

### 1. Registration Step Indicator
- **Mobile View**: Shows only current and next step to save space
- **Hamburger Menu**: Added a side sheet accessible via hamburger menu that displays all steps
- **Implementation**: Modified `registration-step-indicator.tsx` with responsive design

### 2. Registration Type Selection
- **Title**: "Select Registration Type" now appears on one line
- **Description**: Hidden the longer description text on mobile
- **Card Layout**: Implemented horizontal cards for mobile (vs vertical on desktop)
- **Implementation**: Updated `registration-type-step.tsx` with mobile-specific components

### 3. Page Layout
- **Viewport Height**: Used modern viewport units (svh, dvh) for better mobile layouts
- **Header/Footer**: Constrained to consistent heights
- **Main Content**: Set to flex-grow and scroll when needed
- **Implementation**: Updated `registration-wizard.tsx` with flex layout

## Technical Implementation

### Dynamic Viewport Units
Used the newer viewport height units for better mobile experience:
- `svh` (Small Viewport Height): For when mobile UI elements are visible
- `dvh` (Dynamic Viewport Height): For responsive updates as UI changes

### Responsive Design Approach
- Used Tailwind's responsive modifier classes (`md:`, `hidden md:block`, etc.)
- Conditionally rendered different layouts using the `useIsMobile()` hook
- Maintained a single component structure with responsive variations

### Navigation Improvements
- Added a sheet component from shadcn/ui for the step navigation on mobile
- Preserved all step navigation functionality in a space-efficient manner

## Testing Verification
The implementation was verified on:
- Mobile phone viewports (320px - 480px width)
- Tablet viewports (600px - 1024px width)
- Desktop viewports (1024px+)

## Future Considerations
- Consider applying similar mobile optimizations to other steps in the registration flow
- Evaluate form input sizes on mobile devices for easier interaction
- Consider implementing progressive reduction of UI elements as viewport size decreases

## Files Modified
1. `/components/register/RegistrationWizard/Shared/registration-step-indicator.tsx`
2. `/components/register/RegistrationWizard/Steps/registration-type-step.tsx`
3. `/components/register/RegistrationWizard/registration-wizard.tsx`
