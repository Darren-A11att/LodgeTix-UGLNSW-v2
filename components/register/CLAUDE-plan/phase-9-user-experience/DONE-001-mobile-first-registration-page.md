## Completed Requirements
✅ Used dynamic viewport height units (svh, dvh) for better mobile layout
✅ Step indicator now shows only current and next step on mobile
✅ Added hamburger menu in the header for full step navigation
✅ "Select Registration Type" is now on one line with `whitespace-nowrap`
✅ Maintained divider below the heading
✅ Hidden "Please select how you would like..." text on mobile with `hidden md:block`
✅ Created horizontal layout for registration type cards on mobile
✅ Constrained footer to same viewport height as header

## Implementation Details

### 1. Mobile-Optimized Step Indicator
- Updated `registration-step-indicator.tsx` to filter steps shown on mobile
- Added a hamburger menu that reveals all steps in a side sheet
- Used the `useIsMobile()` hook to conditionally render mobile UI

### 2. Registration Type Layout
- Modified `registration-type-step.tsx` to use different layouts on mobile vs desktop
- Added a horizontal card layout for mobile with icon on left, content on right
- Implemented space-efficient layout with minimal text and prominent select button

### 3. Viewport Height Constraints
- Updated `registration-wizard.tsx` to use dynamic viewport height units (`svh`, `dvh`)
- Created a flex column layout with header, main content, and footer
- Fixed header and footer heights with consistent padding
- Main content area has `overflow-y-auto` to enable scrolling when needed

## Technical Notes
- Used Tailwind's responsive utility classes throughout for conditional rendering
- Maintained accessibility with proper ARIA attributes in navigation
- Kept the same functionality while optimizing the interface for mobile devices

## Verification
- Tested layouts at various viewport sizes
- Verified step navigation works correctly on mobile
