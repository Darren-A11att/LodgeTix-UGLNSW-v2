# Mobile Implementation Plan

## Overview
This implementation plan addresses the issues identified in the current mobile experience and outlines a step-by-step approach to create a best-in-class mobile design.

## Core Objectives
1. Fix header sizing and spacing
2. Eliminate scrolling to footer 
3. Implement proper container layout constraints
4. Optimize card spacing and visual hierarchy
5. Ensure consistent experience across all device sizes

## Phase 1: Fix Header Sizing and Spacing

### Step 1.1: Update Header Component
- Increase vertical padding in the header
- Standardize spacing between hamburger icon and text
- Apply proper font-size and weight to the header text
- Add shadow or border to clearly define the header boundary

### Step 1.2: Adjust Header Position
- Ensure the header is properly fixed to the top of the viewport
- Apply z-index to keep header above scrolling content
- Use `position: sticky` with proper fallbacks for older browsers

### Step 1.3: Improve Step Indicator Integration
- Ensure proper spacing between header and step indicator
- Use consistent styling for active/inactive steps
- Apply consistent margin below step indicator

## Phase 2: Eliminate Footer Scrolling Issues

### Step 2.1: Apply Strict Container Constraints
- Revisit container layout structure
- Apply height constraints with !important where needed to override conflicts
- Use the most specific selectors possible to ensure styles are applied

### Step 2.2: Fix Main Content Scrolling
- Ensure main content area is the only scrollable element
- Apply `overflow: hidden` to parent containers
- Set explicit `overflow-y: auto` only on the content container

### Step 2.3: Fix Footer Positioning
- Apply absolute positioning to the footer if needed
- Ensure footer is included within the viewport constraints
- Test various scroll positions to verify footer behavior

## Phase 3: Implement Proper Container Layout

### Step 3.1: Audit Container Structure
- Review and simplify the container hierarchy if possible
- Identify and eliminate conflicting flex properties
- Apply consistent box-sizing across containers

### Step 3.2: Apply Explicit Height Constraints
- Use CSS custom properties for viewport heights
- Apply maximum height constraints to prevent overflow
- Use defensive CSS to prevent layout breaking

### Step 3.3: Isolate Scrollable Areas
- Create explicit scrollable containers with boundaries
- Prevent scroll event propagation between containers
- Apply inertial scrolling properties for smoother experience

## Phase 4: Optimize Card Spacing and Format

### Step 4.1: Revise Card Margins and Padding
- Reduce excessive margins between cards
- Apply consistent internal padding within cards
- Use more compact spacing for mobile viewports

### Step 4.2: Improve Button Placement
- Move action buttons to thumb-friendly zones
- Standardize button sizing for touch targets
- Apply visual differentiation between primary/secondary actions

### Step 4.3: Refine Content Density
- Optimize information hierarchy within cards
- Use progressive disclosure for secondary information
- Apply consistent truncation for long text

## Phase 5: Test and Verify

### Step 5.1: Device Testing
- Test on multiple physical devices with different screen sizes
- Verify behavior on iOS and Android browsers
- Test with different viewport settings (zoomed, etc.)

### Step 5.2: Edge Case Testing
- Test with very tall content
- Test with very short content
- Test with rapid scrolling and interaction patterns

### Step 5.3: Performance Testing
- Verify scroll performance is smooth
- Test touch response time
- Ensure no layout shifts during interaction

## Implementation Strategy

For each phase, we will:
1. Make targeted changes to specific components
2. Test the changes immediately after implementation
3. Document any side effects or unexpected behaviors
4. Make adjustments as needed before proceeding to the next phase

This structured approach ensures we maintain a working system throughout the implementation process while systematically addressing each issue.
