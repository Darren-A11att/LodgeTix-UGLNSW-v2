# Analysis of Current Mobile Implementation

## Current Issues Observed

Based on the screenshot provided and previous implementation, I can identify several critical issues with the current mobile implementation:

### 1. Header Sizing Problems
- The header appears too small and compressed
- The hamburger menu icon and "Registration" text are not properly sized or spaced
- The vertical proportions of the header don't match design standards

### 2. Scrolling Behavior Issues
- The page still scrolls all the way to the footer
- This indicates the layout isn't properly constrained to the viewport
- Content isn't being properly contained within the scrollable area

### 3. Layout Constraint Issues
- Despite implementing `min-height: 100dvh` and `max-height: 100dvh`, the content doesn't appear to be properly constrained
- The footer is still being pushed below the viewport
- Suggests CSS specificity issues or implementation conflicts

### 4. Card Design Problems
- Cards appear to have too much spacing between them
- The "Show Features" button placement doesn't follow best practices for mobile touch targets
- The overall content density could be improved

### 5. Visual Hierarchy Issues
- The page heading "Select Registration Type" is too far from the step indicator
- The gold divider takes up unnecessary vertical space
- Overall, the visual elements don't create an optimal hierarchy for mobile

## Root Cause Analysis

After examining the implementation, I can identify several potential root causes:

### 1. CSS Specificity and Inheritance
Our CSS modifications in `globals.css` may not have sufficient specificity to override existing styles. The classes we added might be getting overridden by more specific selectors elsewhere.

### 2. Container Structure Issues
The nested container structure appears to have conflicting flex properties or structural issues. The combination of `flex-1`, `overflow-y-auto`, and height constraints may be conflicting.

### 3. Incomplete Implementation of Viewport Constraints
The viewport height constraints might be applied inconsistently across containers, or there may be elements with fixed heights that are creating layout issues.

### 4. Possible Event Bubbling
If scroll events are being handled at multiple levels, this could explain why scrolling behavior isn't contained properly.

### 5. Component-Level Style Overrides
Component-specific styles may be overriding our global layout constraints.

## Impact Assessment

These issues are significantly impacting the mobile user experience:

1. **Usability Impact**: Users have to scroll more than necessary, creating friction
2. **Visual Impact**: The compressed header and spacing issues create an unprofessional appearance
3. **Interaction Impact**: The layout doesn't optimize for mobile interaction patterns
4. **Consistency Impact**: The experience doesn't match best practices for mobile web applications

In the next phase, I'll develop a comprehensive plan to address these issues systemically rather than with isolated fixes.
