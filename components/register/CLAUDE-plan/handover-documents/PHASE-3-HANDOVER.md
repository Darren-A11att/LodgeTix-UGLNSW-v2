### Dependencies on Other Streams
- None directly. This phase creates foundational components for Phase 4 form compositions
- Components reference `@/lib/registrationStore` and `@/lib/locationStore` which should already exist

## Technical Details

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Decision**: Created centralized constants and business logic files
   - **Reason**: Avoid code duplication and ensure consistency
   - **Alternative Considered**: Keep logic within components
   
2. **Decision**: Used TypeScript interface inheritance for AttendeeData
   - **Reason**: Allows Mason-specific fields to be optional
   - **Alternative Considered**: Separate interfaces for each type

3. **Decision**: Created backward compatibility wrappers for all components
   - **Reason**: Allow existing code to continue working during migration
   - **Alternative Considered**: Direct replacement requiring immediate updates

4. **Decision**: AutocompleteInput kept as single-select only
   - **Reason**: Registration is for one Grand Lodge and one Lodge only
   - **Alternative Considered**: Multi-select capability

5. **Decision**: Dietary requirements limited to 200 characters
   - **Reason**: Business requirement to keep entries concise
   - **Alternative Considered**: 500 characters (original implementation)

6. **Decision**: Grand Officer roles limited to 5 senior roles + "Other"
   - **Reason**: 70+ roles per Grand Lodge would make dropdown unwieldy
   - **Alternative Considered**: Complete list of all roles

### Implementation Notes
```typescript
// Key pattern: SectionProps interface for consistency
export interface SectionProps {
  data: AttendeeData;
  type: 'Mason' | 'Guest';
  isPrimary?: boolean;
  onChange: (field: string, value: any) => void;
}

// All section components follow this pattern
export const SectionComponent: React.FC<SectionProps> = ({ 
  data, 
  type, 
  isPrimary, 
  onChange 
}) => {
  // Implementation
};
```

### Known Issues/Bugs
1. **Issue**: Constants file was automatically updated by linter
   - **Impact**: Added type exports and helper functions
   - **Workaround**: Already applied, enhanced the file
   - **Proposed Fix**: Keep the improvements, they add value

### Technical Debt
- [ ] FieldComponents.tsx was updated with proper validation after creation
- [ ] AutocompleteInput needs accessibility improvements
- [ ] No unit tests written yet

## Testing Status

### Unit Tests
- Coverage: 0%
- Key test files:
  - None created yet - all components need test coverage

### Integration Tests
- [ ] None written yet
- [ ] Need tests for autocomplete functionality
- [ ] Need tests for business logic functions

### Manual Testing
- [ ] BasicInfo component needs testing with both Mason/Guest
- [ ] ContactInfo conditional display needs verification
- [ ] Lodge selection with creation dialog needs testing
- [ ] Grand Officer fields conditional display needs testing

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. Start with task [071] - Create MasonForm
   - Prerequisites: All Phase 3 components complete
   - Estimated time: 2-3 hours
   - Key considerations: Must compose all sections properly

2. Then move to task [072] - Create GuestForm
   - Dependencies: Task 071 pattern established
   - Complexity: Medium
   - Key considerations: Simpler than MasonForm

### Blockers/Risks
- **Risk**: AutocompleteInput may have performance issues with large datasets
  - **Impact**: Slow lodge/grand lodge selection
  - **Resolution**: Add debouncing and result limiting
  - **Owner**: Dev implementing Phase 4

### Questions for Team
1. ~~Should the AutocompleteInput support multi-select for future use?~~ **ANSWERED**: No, single-select only
2. ~~Should dietary requirements have a character limit?~~ **ANSWERED**: Yes, 200 characters
3. ~~Do we need to support additional Grand Officer roles beyond the current list?~~ **ANSWERED**: No, current list plus "Other" is sufficient

## Environment Setup

### Required Tools/Access
- [ ] Access to Supabase for lodge/grand lodge data
- [ ] Environment variable: `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- [ ] Environment variable: `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

### Local Development Setup
```bash
# No special setup needed beyond standard
npm install
# Ensure all UI components are installed
npm install @/components/ui/*
```

### Configuration Changes
- No configuration changes made
- All components use existing infrastructure

## Important Context

### Business Logic Notes
- Title and Rank have interdependencies (Grand titles force GL rank)
- Contact preferences affect field visibility
- Grand Officer fields only show for GL rank
- Partners are always Guests, never Masons
- Lodge selection depends on Grand Lodge selection
- One attendee can only register for one Grand Lodge and one Lodge
- Dietary requirements limited to 200 characters for conciseness
- Grand Officer roles limited to senior positions, others handled via custom input

### Performance Considerations
- AutocompleteInput uses debouncing (300ms default)
- Lodge cache strategy implemented but needs verification
- Large lodge lists may need pagination

### Security Considerations
- No security issues identified
- All data stays client-side until form submission
- Proper input sanitization in place

## Additional Notes

### Key Implementation Details
1. All components follow the pattern established in CLAUDE.md exactly
2. Backward compatibility wrappers maintain existing interfaces
3. Business logic properly separated from UI components
4. Type safety maintained throughout with TypeScript

### Files Enhanced by Linter
The following files were automatically enhanced after creation:
- constants.ts: Added type exports and helper functions
- businessLogic.ts: Added more comprehensive business logic
- FieldComponents.tsx: Replaced with proper validation and formatting

These enhancements improve the codebase and should be retained.

### Business Requirements Clarifications
After implementation, the following requirements were clarified:
1. AutocompleteInput is single-select only (no multi-select needed)
2. Dietary requirements limited to 200 characters
3. Grand Officer roles list is sufficient with "Other" option for edge cases

### Next Phase Considerations
Phase 4 will compose these sections into complete forms:
- MasonForm will need all six sections
- GuestForm will need three sections (BasicInfo, ContactInfo, AdditionalInfo)
- Form validation will need to be implemented
- Form persistence will need to be added
