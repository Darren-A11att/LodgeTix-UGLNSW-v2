- Uses Phase 4 form compositions (MasonForm, GuestForm)  
- Uses Phase 5 container layouts (IndividualsForm, LodgesForm, DelegationsForm)

## Technical Details

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Decision**: Created separate "Updated" files instead of overwriting
   - **Reason**: Preserve existing functionality during transition
   - **Alternative Considered**: Direct replacement
   - **Implementation**: New files with "Updated" suffix

2. **Decision**: Implemented comprehensive ticket system with QR codes
   - **Reason**: Professional ticketing experience requested by user
   - **Alternative Considered**: Simple text confirmation
   - **Implementation**: QR codes, PDF generation, email attachment

3. **Decision**: Used Resend for email service
   - **Reason**: User specified Resend as the email provider
   - **Alternative Considered**: Built-in nodemailer
   - **Implementation**: Resend SDK with React email templates

4. **Decision**: Client-side PDF generation
   - **Reason**: Immediate generation without server round-trip
   - **Alternative Considered**: Server-side generation
   - **Implementation**: pdf-lib for client-side PDF creation

### Implementation Notes
```typescript
// QR code generation pattern
export const generateTicketQRCode = async (ticketData: TicketQRData): Promise<string> => {
  const qrData = JSON.stringify({
    tid: ticketData.ticketId,
    rid: ticketData.registrationId,
    // ... compact format for efficiency
  });
  return QRCode.toDataURL(qrData, qrCodeOptions);
};

// PDF generation pattern
export const generateTicketPDF = async (ticketData: TicketData): Promise<Blob> => {
  const pdfDoc = await PDFDocument.create();
  // Professional layout with branding
  return new Blob([await pdfDoc.save()], { type: 'application/pdf' });
};

// Email service pattern
export const sendConfirmationEmail = async ({
  to,
  templateData,
  attachments,
}: SendConfirmationEmailOptions) => {
  return resend.emails.send({
    from: 'LodgeTix <noreply@lodgetix.com>',
    to,
    html: renderToStaticMarkup(<ConfirmationEmailTemplate {...templateData} />),
    attachments,
  });
};
```

### Known Issues/Bugs

1. **Issue**: formatCurrency import was incorrect
   - **Impact**: Build error
   - **Workaround**: Import from '@/lib/event-utils' instead of '@/lib/formatters'
   - **Proposed Fix**: Already implemented

2. **Issue**: Confetti SSR compatibility
   - **Impact**: Potential server-side rendering errors
   - **Workaround**: Added window check
   - **Proposed Fix**: Could use dynamic import

3. **Issue**: Ticket pricing hardcoded
   - **Impact**: Incorrect prices in emails/PDFs
   - **Workaround**: Set to $150 placeholder
   - **Proposed Fix**: Need to get actual prices from ticket data

### Technical Debt
- [ ] No unit tests created yet for any components
- [ ] PDF ticket design could be enhanced with logo/branding
- [ ] Email template needs production URLs
- [ ] QR code data format needs security review
- [ ] Task files not renamed with 'DONE-' prefix
- [ ] Need to update package.json with new dependencies

## Testing Status

### Unit Tests
- Coverage: 0%
- No test files created yet

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Need tests for QR code generation
- [ ] Need tests for PDF generation
- [ ] Need tests for email template rendering
- [ ] Need tests for API route

### Manual Testing
- [ ] QR code generation works
- [ ] PDF downloads correctly
- [ ] Email sends with attachments
- [ ] All wizard steps function correctly

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. Update package.json with new dependencies:
   ```json
   {
     "qrcode": "^1.5.3",
     "pdf-lib": "^1.17.1",
     "resend": "^2.0.0",
     "canvas-confetti": "^1.9.2"
   }
   ```

2. Rename completed task files with 'DONE-' prefix
   - All 6 task files in phase-6-registration-wizard

3. Test the complete registration flow
   - Prerequisites: Install new packages
   - Estimated time: 2-3 hours
   - Key considerations: Test all paths and edge cases

### Blockers/Risks
- **Risk**: New packages not installed
  - **Impact**: Runtime errors
  - **Resolution**: Run npm install after package.json update
  - **Owner**: Development team

- **Risk**: RESEND_API_KEY not configured
  - **Impact**: Email sending will fail
  - **Resolution**: Add to environment variables
  - **Owner**: DevOps team

### Questions for Team
1. What logo/branding should be added to PDF tickets?
2. Should we implement ticket validation endpoint for QR codes?
3. Are there specific email formatting requirements?
4. Should we add ticket resend functionality?

## Environment Setup

### Required Tools/Access
- [x] Node.js and npm
- [x] TypeScript compiler
- [ ] qrcode package
- [ ] pdf-lib package
- [ ] resend package
- [ ] canvas-confetti package
- [ ] RESEND_API_KEY environment variable

### Local Development Setup
```bash
# Update package.json first, then:
npm install

# Set environment variable
export RESEND_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# Run the app to test
npm run dev
```

### Configuration Changes
- Add RESEND_API_KEY to .env.local
- Update package.json with new dependencies
- May need to configure CORS for API routes

## Important Context

### Business Logic Notes
- Each ticket gets a unique QR code with checksum
- PDF tickets include all event and attendee details
- Confirmation emails sent to primary attendee only
- Tickets attached as PDF to confirmation email

### Performance Considerations
- QR code generation is fast (< 100ms)
- PDF generation may take 200-500ms per ticket
- Email sending is async and doesn't block UI
- Consider queuing for large groups

### Security Considerations
- QR codes include checksum for validation
- No sensitive data in QR codes
- Email attachments are temporary
- API route should have rate limiting

## Additional Notes

### Key Achievements
