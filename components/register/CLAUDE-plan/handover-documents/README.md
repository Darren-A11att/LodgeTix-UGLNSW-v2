# Handover Documents

This directory contains handover documents for each phase of the forms refactoring project. These documents ensure continuity when developers need to hand off work to others.

## Purpose

Handover documents serve to:
- Provide context for developers taking over a stream
- Document decisions and technical details
- Track progress and remaining work
- Identify blockers and dependencies
- Ensure smooth transitions between developers

## Structure

Each phase should have its own handover document:
- `PHASE-1-HANDOVER.md` - Phase 1 Foundation handover
- `PHASE-2-HANDOVER.md` - Phase 2 Shared Components handover
- `PHASE-3-HANDOVER.md` - Phase 3 Form Sections handover
- etc.

## When to Create/Update

Create or update a handover document:
- At the end of each phase
- Before any planned absence
- When switching to a different stream
- When significant decisions are made
- When blockers are encountered

## Template

Use the template provided in `write-handover-document.md` to ensure consistency across all handover documents.

## Example

See `PHASE-1-HANDOVER-EXAMPLE.md` for a completed example showing the expected level of detail.

## Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: Include file paths, function names, and code snippets
2. **Document Decisions**: Explain why choices were made
3. **List Dependencies**: Note what you need from other streams
4. **Identify Blockers**: Be clear about what's preventing progress
5. **Update Regularly**: Don't wait until the last minute
6. **Include Context**: Assume the reader has no prior knowledge
