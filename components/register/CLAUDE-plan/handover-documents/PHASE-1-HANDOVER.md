## Technical Details

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Decision**: Use lowercase directory names
   - **Reason**: Consistency with modern React conventions
   - **Alternative Considered**: Keep PascalCase directories
   - **Implementation**: All new directories use lowercase (e.g., `forms/attendee`, not `Forms/Attendee`)

2. **Decision**: Separate hooks into lib directory
   - **Reason**: Clear separation between state management and UI
   - **Alternative Considered**: Co-locate hooks with components
   - **Implementation**: All hooks in `forms/attendee/lib/` directory

3. **Decision**: Extract all constants, validation, and formatting to utils
   - **Reason**: Single source of truth, reusability
   - **Alternative Considered**: Keep logic within components
   - **Implementation**: Utilities in `forms/attendee/utils/` directory

4. **Decision**: Use AttendeeData as primary type name
   - **Reason**: Clearer naming convention per user preference
   - **Alternative Considered**: UnifiedAttendeeData from store
   - **Implementation**: All new code uses `AttendeeData`, imported from `../types`
   - **Note**: Store still uses `UnifiedAttendeeData`, but our interface uses `AttendeeData`

5. **Decision**: No validation for Mason rank/title combinations
   - **Reason**: Too many edge cases to handle properly
   - **Alternative Considered**: Strict validation rules
   - **Implementation**: Only helpful suggestions in `businessLogic.ts`, no validation errors
   - **Example**: Selecting "VW Bro" will suggest "GL" rank but won't enforce it

6. **Decision**: Character limits for name fields
   - **Reason**: UI consistency and database constraints
   - **Alternative Considered**: Longer limits (50 chars)
   - **Implementation**: 20 character limit per name field (firstName, lastName)

7. **Decision**: Use native browser email validation
   - **Reason**: Better UX, standard implementation
   - **Alternative Considered**: Custom regex validation
   - **Implementation**: Use `type="email"` on input elements

8. **Decision**: Use PhoneInput component for phone validation
   - **Reason**: Consistent with existing codebase
   - **Alternative Considered**: Custom phone validation
   - **Implementation**: Import from `@/components/ui/phone-input`

### Implementation Notes

#### Type Usage Pattern
```typescript
// Import AttendeeData for all new code
import { AttendeeData } from '../types';

// Store still uses UnifiedAttendeeData internally
// but we map to AttendeeData in our interfaces
const attendee = attendees.find((a) => a.attendeeId === attendeeId) as AttendeeData;
```

#### Debounced Updates Pattern
```typescript
export const useAttendeeDataWithDebounce = (attendeeId: string, delay = 300) => {
  const { updateField, ...rest } = useAttendeeData(attendeeId);
  const debouncedUpdateField = useDebouncedCallback(updateField, delay);
  
  return {
    ...rest,
    updateField: debouncedUpdateField,
    updateFieldImmediate: updateField,
  };
};
```

#### Rank/Title Suggestion Pattern
```typescript
// In businessLogic.ts - suggestions only, no validation
export const handleTitleChange = (
  title: string, 
  currentRank: string
): Partial<AttendeeData> => {
  const updates: Partial<AttendeeData> = { title };
  
  // Helpful suggestions, not enforced
  if (title === 'W Bro' && currentRank !== 'GL') {
    updates.rank = 'IM'; // Suggests Installed Master
  } else if (isGrandTitle(title)) {
    updates.rank = 'GL'; // Suggests Grand Lodge
  }
  
  return updates;
};
```

#### Validation Pattern
```typescript
// Name validation with 20 char limit
export const validateName = (name: string): boolean => {
  if (!name) return false;
  const trimmed = name.trim();
  return trimmed.length >= 2 && trimmed.length <= 20;
};

// Email validation deferred to browser
// Use type="email" on input elements
```

### Known Issues/Bugs

1. **Issue**: Type mismatch between AttendeeData and UnifiedAttendeeData
   - **Impact**: Potential type errors when interfacing with store
   - **Workaround**: Type casting where necessary
   - **Proposed Fix**: This is intentional - AttendeeData is our interface, store uses UnifiedAttendeeData
   - **Resolution**: RESOLVED - Per user decision, using AttendeeData as naming convention

### Technical Debt
- [ ] Need to add unit tests for all utilities
- [ ] Consider adding JSDoc comments for public APIs
- [ ] May need to optimize performance of validation functions

## Testing Status

### Unit Tests
- Coverage: 0%
- No test files created yet

### Integration Tests
- [ ] No integration tests written

### Manual Testing
- [ ] Hooks not tested in components yet
- [ ] Utilities need to be tested with real data
- [ ] Validation rules need to be verified against requirements

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. Start with Phase 2 - Shared Components
   - Prerequisites: Phase 1 foundation complete
   - Estimated time: 4-6 hours
   - Key considerations: Use the utilities created in Phase 1

2. Create unit tests for Phase 1 utilities
   - Dependencies: None
   - Complexity: Medium

### Blockers/Risks
- **Risk**: Some existing components still use PascalCase directories
  - **Impact**: May cause confusion during refactoring
  - **Resolution**: Ensure new components use lowercase
  - **Owner**: Developer on Phase 2

### Questions for Team (ANSWERED)
1. ~~Should we standardize on AttendeeData or UnifiedAttendeeData for types?~~
   - **Answer**: Use AttendeeData as the primary type name throughout the refactoring
2. ~~Are there any additional validation rules not captured in the old forms?~~
   - **Answer**: 
     - Email: Use input type="email" for browser validation
     - Phone: Use @/components/ui/phone-input component
     - Names: 20 characters max each field
     - No validation for Mason rank/title combinations (only helpful suggestions)
3. ~~Should we add i18n support for error messages?~~
   - **Answer**: Not required at this stage, keep English messages

## Environment Setup

### Required Tools/Access
- [x] Access to TypeScript/React environment
- [x] Node.js and npm installed
- [ ] Access to Supabase for testing store integration

### Local Development Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# TypeScript compilation check
npm run type-check

# No specific Phase 1 setup required
```

### Configuration Changes
- Added to `tsconfig.json`: Path aliases for new structure
- Created `components/register/forms/tsconfig.json`: Module-specific config

## Important Context

### Business Logic Notes

#### Mason Rank/Title Logic
- **Principle**: Suggestions only, not enforced validation
- **Implementation**: `businessLogic.handleTitleChange()` provides helpful suggestions
- **Example Behaviors**:
  - Selecting "VW Bro" → suggests "GL" rank (not required)
  - Selecting "W Bro" → suggests "IM" rank if not already "GL"
  - User can override any suggestion

#### Field Visibility Rules
- **Grand Officer Fields**: Only visible when `rank === 'GL'`
- **Contact Fields**: Visible when `isPrimary` OR `contactPreference === 'Directly'`
- **Confirmation Message**: Shown when `!isPrimary` AND (`contactPreference === 'PrimaryAttendee'` OR `'ProvideLater'`)
- **Partner Forms**: Always render as Guest type

#### Validation Rules
- **Name Fields**: 2-20 characters each (firstName, lastName)
- **Email**: Browser validation via `type="email"`
- **Phone**: Component validation via `@/components/ui/phone-input`
- **Mason Rank**: Required field, no compatibility validation
- **Grand Officer**: Required when rank is GL and isPrimary

#### Type System Notes
- **AttendeeData**: Our interface type (in `types.ts`)
- **UnifiedAttendeeData**: Store's type (from Supabase)
- **Convention**: Use AttendeeData in new code, cast where needed

### Performance Considerations
- Used debounced updates for form fields (50ms default)
- Validation functions should be memoized if used frequently
- Consider lazy loading utilities in production

### Security Considerations
- Email validation includes basic format checking
- Phone validation allows international formats
- No PII stored in localStorage for persistence

## Additional Notes

Phase 1 establishes the foundation for the entire refactoring project. All utilities and hooks are designed to be reusable across different form types. The architecture follows the specifications in `components/register/CLAUDE.md` exactly.

Key patterns established:
1. Separation of business logic from UI
2. Type-safe data management with Zustand
3. Reusable validation and formatting utilities
4. Clear hook interfaces for component consumption

Next phase should start building the shared UI components using these utilities.

## Updates Made Post-Questions

Based on the team's answers, the following updates were made:

### 1. Type Standardization
- Changed all references from `UnifiedAttendeeData` to `AttendeeData`
- Cleaned up imports to use only `AttendeeData` throughout
- Added proper type definitions for forms and sections
- Files updated: All files in `forms/attendee/lib/` and `forms/attendee/utils/`

### 2. Validation Updates
- Changed name validation from 50 to 20 characters
- Removed Mason rank/title validation rules entirely
- Updated error messages to reflect character limits
- Removed `validateMasonRank()` function
- Files updated: `utils/validation.ts`

### 3. Business Logic Updates  
- Changed rank/title interactions to be suggestions only
- Kept helpful auto-suggestions but removed enforcement
- Modified `handleTitleChange()` to return suggestions without validation
- Files updated: `utils/businessLogic.ts`

### 4. Code Examples

#### Before (with validation):
```typescript
export const validateMasonRank = (title: string, rank: string): boolean => {
  if (GRAND_TITLES.includes(title) && rank !== 'GL') {
    return false; // Validation error
  }
  return true;
};
```

#### After (suggestions only):
```typescript
export const handleTitleChange = (title: string, currentRank: string): Partial<AttendeeData> => {
  const updates: Partial<AttendeeData> = { title };
  
  if (title === 'W Bro' && currentRank !== 'GL') {
    updates.rank = 'IM'; // Just a suggestion
  }
  
  return updates;
};
```

## Critical Decisions Summary

1. **AttendeeData vs UnifiedAttendeeData**: Use AttendeeData as naming convention
2. **Mason Rank/Title**: Suggestions only, no validation rules
3. **Name Length**: 20 characters maximum per field  
4. **Email Validation**: Use browser native `type="email"`
5. **Phone Validation**: Use existing PhoneInput component
6. **Type Casting**: Accept that store uses different type name
