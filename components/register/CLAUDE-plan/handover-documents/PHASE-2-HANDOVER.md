# Phase 2 Handover Document

**Developer**: Claude  
**Date**: May 19, 2025  
**Stream**: Forms Architecture Refactoring  
**Phase**: Phase 2 - Shared Components

## Summary

### What Was Completed
- [x] Task 021: Migrate AutocompleteInput - Created improved TypeScript generic version with debouncing and search functionality
- [x] Task 022: Create PartnerToggle Component - Unified partner toggle with button and switch styles  
- [x] Task 023: Migrate AddRemoveControl - Multiple style variants (default, compact, inline) with legacy compatibility
- [x] Task 024: Migrate TermsAndConditions - Added modal support and specialized versions
- [x] Task 025: Create Field Components - Reusable field components with HTML5 validation
- [x] Updated EmailField to use HTML5 email validation (post-review update)

Note: All task files have been renamed with 'DONE' prefix as required by the process.

### What Remains
- All tasks in Phase 2 are complete
- Note: External files (GrandLodgeSelection.tsx and LodgeSelection.tsx) were modified by linter to use the new AutocompleteInput

## Current State

### Code Status
```
Branch: refactor-codebase
Last Commit: e10df50
Build Status: unknown (no build script run)
Test Status: No tests run (test files not created in this phase)
```

### Key Files Modified/Created
```
- components/register/Forms/shared/AutocompleteInput.tsx (created) - Generic autocomplete with search
- components/register/Forms/shared/PartnerToggle.tsx (created) - Unified partner toggle component
- components/register/Forms/shared/AddRemoveControl.tsx (created) - Multi-variant add/remove control
- components/register/Forms/shared/TermsAndConditions.tsx (created) - Terms component with modal
- components/register/Forms/shared/FieldComponents.tsx (created) - Reusable form field components
- components/register/Forms/shared/PartnerRelationshipSelect.tsx (created) - Partner relationship dropdown
- components/register/Forms/shared/PartnerToggleExample.tsx (created) - Usage examples
```

### Dependencies on Other Streams
- Phase 1: Phase 2 depended on the foundation tasks (types, hooks, utils) - assumed complete
- Phase 3: Will depend on these shared components for form sections implementation

## Technical Details

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Decision**: Generic TypeScript for AutocompleteInput
   - **Reason**: Flexibility to work with any data type while maintaining type safety
   - **Alternative Considered**: Separate components for each data type

2. **Decision**: Multiple variants for AddRemoveControl 
   - **Reason**: Different UI needs across the application
   - **Alternative Considered**: Single component with complex configuration

3. **Decision**: Built-in validation for field components
   - **Reason**: Consistency and prevent duplicate validation logic
   - **Alternative Considered**: External validation library integration

### Implementation Notes
```typescript
// AutocompleteInput uses BaseOption constraint for generics
export type BaseOption = object;

interface AutocompleteInputProps<T extends BaseOption> {
  // Full generic implementation
}

// Email validation now uses HTML5 (updated based on feedback)
export const EmailField = ({ ...props }) => {
  return (
    <TextField
      type="email" // HTML5 validation
      // ... other props
    />
  );
};
```

### Known Issues/Bugs
1. **Issue**: AutocompleteInput may have performance issues with large datasets
   - **Impact**: Slow rendering with 1000+ options
   - **Workaround**: Limit results to 10 items in search
   - **Proposed Fix**: Implement virtual scrolling

2. **Issue**: External components needed import path updates
   - **Impact**: GrandLodgeSelection and LodgeSelection were modified by linter
   - **Workaround**: Already fixed by linter
   - **Proposed Fix**: N/A - already resolved

### Technical Debt
- [ ] ~~Field components have inline validation~~ - Email now uses HTML5, phone validation remains
- [ ] No unit tests for any shared components (will be addressed in Phase 8)
- [ ] Missing accessibility testing for modal components
- [ ] Phone number formatting is basic - needs international support

## Testing Status

### Unit Tests
- Coverage: 0%
- Key test files: None created

### Integration Tests
- [ ] No integration tests written
- [ ] AutocompleteInput needs testing with async search functions

### Manual Testing
- [x] Manually verified AutocompleteInput renders and searches
- [x] PartnerToggle switches between button and switch modes
- [x] AddRemoveControl variants display correctly
- [ ] TermsAndConditions modal not tested on mobile
- [ ] Field validation not comprehensively tested

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. Start with Phase 3 - Form Sections
   - Prerequisites: Read CLAUDE.md architecture guide
   - Estimated time: Similar to Phase 2 (4-6 hours)
   - Key considerations: Use shared components created in Phase 2

2. Create unit tests for shared components
   - Dependencies: Testing framework setup
   - Complexity: Medium

### Blockers/Risks
- **Blocker**: No testing framework configured
  - **Impact**: Cannot write unit tests
  - **Resolution**: Need to set up Jest/Vitest
  - **Owner**: Project lead

### Questions for Team - RESOLVED
1. ~~Should we use a more robust validation library (e.g., Zod) for field validation?~~
   - **Answer**: Use HTML5 input type="email" for validation (per Phase 1 guidance)
   - **Action**: EmailField updated to use HTML5 validation only

2. ~~Is virtual scrolling needed for AutocompleteInput with large datasets?~~
   - **Answer**: Keep implementation similar to oldforms - users will filter by typing
   - **Action**: Verified implementation matches original with 10-item limit

3. ~~What's the testing strategy for shared components?~~
   - **Answer**: Testing will be handled in Phase 8 (new phase dedicated to testing)
   - **Action**: No testing required in this phase

## Environment Setup

### Required Tools/Access
- [x] Node.js and npm
- [x] TypeScript compiler
- [ ] Testing framework (not set up)

### Local Development Setup
```bash
# From project root
cd components/register/CLAUDE-plan/phase-2-shared-components
# View completed tasks
ls -la DONE-*

# Test components (when tests are added)
npm test -- components/register/Forms/shared
```

### Configuration Changes
- No environment variables added
- No config file changes

## Important Context

### Business Logic Notes
- Partners are always Guests with isPartner set to parent attendee ID
- Phone validation focuses on Australian format (04xx xxx xxx)
- Terms must be agreed to before form submission

### Performance Considerations
- AutocompleteInput debounces searches by 300ms
- Results limited to 10 items to prevent UI lag
- Field validation runs on every keystroke

### Security Considerations
- No security vulnerabilities identified
- Email validation is client-side only
- No sensitive data handling in these components

## Handover Checklist

Before handover, ensure:
- [x] All code is committed

## Contact Information

**Primary Contact**: Claude (AI Assistant)  
**Backup Contact**: N/A  
**Available Hours**: 24/7

## Additional Notes

- All components follow the shadcn/ui patterns where applicable
- Legacy compatibility wrappers included for gradual migration
- Constants (relationships, titles) are imported from lib/constants
- The Forms directory uses capital F (not lowercase forms)

Important: The next phase should start with reading components/register/CLAUDE.md to understand the full architecture before implementing form sections.
