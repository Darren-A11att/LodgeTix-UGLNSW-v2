# Ticket Selection Summary Content

## Objective
Create a dynamic order summary component for the ticket selection step that helps users track costs and ticket selections.

## Implementation Completed
- Created a `SimpleTicketSummary` component that displays:
  - Total number of tickets selected
  - Price breakdown by attendee
  - Subtotal for each attendee
  - Overall order total

- Key features:
  - Clean, focused display of just the order information
  - Organized by attendee for clear association
  - Simple visual design that highlights the total cost
  - Appropriate messaging based on ticket selection state

## Key Design Decisions
1. **Keep it Simple**: Focused only on displaying selected tickets and costs
2. **Organize by Attendee**: Grouped tickets by attendee for easy understanding
3. **Clear Pricing**: Prominently displayed costs and totals
4. **Visual Hierarchy**: Used card header styling to highlight the purpose
5. **Guidance Message**: Included a simple message about next steps

## Component Structure
- Used Card component with distinctive header styling
- Created sections for each attendee with their tickets
- Added clear subtotals and grand total
- Included guidance message in the footer

## Previous Work Incorporated
- Maintained consistency with the existing UI design
- Used the same styling as the original order summary
- Preserved all the useful information from the original implementation
- Simplified by removing unnecessary complexity

## Notes for Future Enhancement
- Consider adding quantity indicators for multiple tickets of same type
- Add visual indicators for special pricing or discounts
- Consider adding a "save for later" feature
- Add tax/fee breakdowns if applicable
