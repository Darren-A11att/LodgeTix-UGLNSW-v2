# Registration Type Summary Content

## Objective
Create an informative summary component for the registration type step that helps users understand the different registration options and prepare for the registration process.

## Implementation Completed
- Created a dedicated `RegistrationTypeSummary` component that displays:
  - Comparison of all registration types (individual, lodge, delegation)
  - Registration-specific requirements based on the selected type
  - Estimated time commitments for each registration type
  - Process overview showing all steps in the registration flow

- Enhanced the registration-type-step.tsx to:
  - Use TwoColumnStepLayout instead of OneColumnStepLayout
  - Display the RegistrationTypeSummary in the right column
  - Maintain all existing functionality

## Key Design Decisions
1. **Visual Status Indicators**: Used color-coding and icons to clearly indicate which registration type is selected
2. **Contextual Information**: Display specific requirements only for the selected registration type
3. **Process Transparency**: Added a numbered list showing all steps in the registration process with the current step highlighted
4. **Estimated Time Commitments**: Provided time estimates to set user expectations
5. **Information Architecture**: Organized content into distinct sections with clear headings

## Component Structure
- Used the base SummaryColumn component for consistent styling
- Created three main sections:
  1. Registration Options comparison
  2. What You'll Need (requirements specific to selected type)
  3. Registration Process (step overview)
- Implemented responsive design for mobile view

## Notes for Future Enhancement
- Consider adding more detailed contextual help for each registration type
- Add ability to save draft registration more prominently
- Implement session expiration warnings
- Add more visual elements to improve engagement
