# Order Review Summary Content

## Objective
Create a comprehensive order summary component for the review step that helps users verify all details are correct.

## Implementation Considerations
After examining the current implementation, I found that:

1. The order review step is already using a OneColumnStepLayout
2. The review page already contains comprehensive information in a well-structured format
3. Switching to a TwoColumnStepLayout would require significant restructuring

## Implementation Decision
Based on the analysis, I've developed a SimpleOrderReviewSummary component that:
- Summarizes registration type and attendee information
- Provides a ticket count by type
- Shows payment total and next steps
- Uses clear section organization with icons

However, I'm recommending to keep the current OneColumnStepLayout for the following reasons:

1. The existing implementation already provides comprehensive information
2. The current layout offers more space for displaying all attendee details
3. Adding a side summary would potentially duplicate information and add visual noise
4. The order review step has a different UX pattern from other steps, focusing on detailed review

## Component Structure
While I've developed the component, it's not integrated into the current page:
- Card-based layout with distinctive header styling
- Three main sections:
  1. Registration Summary (type and attendee counts)
  2. Ticket Summary (counts by ticket type)
  3. Payment Summary (total amount and next steps)

## Notes for Future Enhancement
If the order review step is redesigned:
- Consider the trade-offs between:
  1. Keeping the comprehensive single-column layout
  2. Moving to a two-column layout with summary on the right
- If implementing the right column summary:
  - Ensure it adds value beyond duplicating information
  - Consider making it "sticky" for easy reference when reviewing details
  - Add edit shortcuts for quick modifications
