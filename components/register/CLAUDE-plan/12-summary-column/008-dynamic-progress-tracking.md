# Dynamic Progress Tracking Component

## Objective
Create a consistent progress tracking component that appears in the summary column across all wizard steps to help users understand their progress and what steps remain.

## Tasks
1. Design a visual progress indicator for the registration process
2. Implement step-specific completion tracking
3. Create estimated time remaining calculations
4. Add navigation shortcuts to previous/upcoming steps

## Implementation Details
- Progress visualization:
  - Step completion indicators (complete, current, upcoming)
  - Percentage complete indicator
  - Visual timeline representation
  - Current step highlighting
  
- Completion tracking:
  - Per-step validation status
  - Required vs completed items count
  - Visual indicators for steps with issues
  - Checkpoint indicators for major milestones
  
- Time estimation:
  - Estimated time remaining calculation
  - Per-step time estimates
  - Adjustment based on user progress
  - Pause/resume time tracking
  
- Navigation elements:
  - Quick jump to previous steps (if allowed)
  - Preview of upcoming step requirements
  - Breadcrumb-style navigation
  - Save and resume later option

## Visual Elements
- Progress bar or step indicator
- Checkmarks for completed steps
- Warning icons for incomplete required information
- Clock/timer icons for time estimates
- Navigation links with appropriate icons

## Dependencies
- Registration wizard navigation system
- Step validation status tracking
- Time estimation logic
- UI components for progress visualization

## Technical Notes
- Progress should update in real-time as users complete items
- Consider adding microinteractions for progress updates
- Ensure all navigation respects validation rules
- Include clear indicators for required vs optional steps
- Progress should persist across sessions
