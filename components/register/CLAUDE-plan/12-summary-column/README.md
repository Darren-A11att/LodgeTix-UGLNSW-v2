# Summary Column Enhancement Project

## Overview
This project aims to significantly improve the user experience in the LodgeTix registration wizard by enhancing the second column (summary column) with contextual, step-specific information and functionality. Each registration step will have a tailored summary view that provides relevant information, controls, and assistance to users.

## Objectives
- Create a consistent yet contextual summary column structure across all steps
- Improve user understanding of the registration process
- Provide real-time feedback on registration progress
- Reduce form errors and abandonment rates
- Support users with helpful information at each step
- Optimize the mobile experience for the summary content

## Task Structure
The tasks in this project are organized sequentially, with each task building upon previous ones:

1. **Core Structure and Design** (tasks 001-002)
   - Establishing consistent patterns and components
   - Creating registration type-specific content

2. **Step-Specific Implementations** (tasks 003-007)
   - Tailored summary content for each wizard step
   - Specialized components for different data types

3. **Cross-Cutting Enhancements** (tasks 008-015)
   - Progress tracking and navigation
   - Mobile optimization
   - Help system integration
   - Save/resume functionality
   - Accessibility improvements
   - Validation display
   - Performance optimizations
   - Analytics integration

## Implementation Guidelines
- Follow the established design system and component library
- Maintain consistency with the existing UI patterns
- Prioritize mobile usability and responsive design
- Ensure all components meet accessibility standards
- Use performance-optimized implementation patterns
- Build with extensibility for future enhancements

## Key Components
- AttendeeSummary
- ProgressTracker
- ValidationStatus
- OrderSummary

- MobileOptimizedCollapse
- ContextualHelp

## Dependencies
This project depends on:
- Registration wizard step components
- Registration data store
- Form validation system
- UI component library
- Device detection utilities

## Completion Criteria
Each task should be considered complete when:
- Component implementation is finished and functional
- Responsive design is verified on all target devices
- Accessibility requirements are met
- Performance metrics meet targets
- Code is properly documented
- Tests are written and passing

Once a task is completed, rename the file with a "DONE-" prefix and update the README to reflect progress.
