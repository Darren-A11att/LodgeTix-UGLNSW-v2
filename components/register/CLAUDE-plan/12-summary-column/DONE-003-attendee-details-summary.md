# Attendee Details Summary Content

## Objective
Create a comprehensive summary component for the attendee details step that helps users track their progress and understand what information is still needed.

## Implementation Completed
- Created an enhanced `AttendeeDetailsSummary` component that displays:
  - Completion status with progress bar
  - Registration type-specific requirements
  - Enhanced attendee listing with status indicators
  - Completion steps guide
  - Quick action buttons for adding attendees and partners

- Key enhancements over the previous implementation:
  - Added real-time completion tracking and progress visualization
  - Included registration-type-specific validation requirements
  - Implemented status indicators for each attendee
  - Added quick action buttons directly in the summary
  - Improved visual organization and information hierarchy

## Key Design Decisions
1. **Attendee Status Calculation**: Created a helper function to analyze each attendee's data completeness
2. **Type-Specific Requirements**: Displayed different requirements based on registration type
3. **Interactive Elements**: Added buttons to add attendees and partners directly from the summary
4. **Visual Status Indicators**: Used color coding and icons to communicate status effectively
5. **Progressive Disclosure**: Organized information in collapsible sections for better usability

## Component Structure
- Used the base `SummaryColumn` component for consistent styling
- Created three main sections:
  1. Completion Status (progress, type-specific requirements)
  2. Attendees List (with status indicators and quick actions)
  3. Completion Steps (with visual cues for current step)
- Implemented responsive design for mobile view

## Previous Work Incorporated
- Built upon the summary column structure created in task 001
- Followed the same design pattern established in the registration type summary
- Maintained consistent styling and interaction patterns

## Notes for Future Enhancement
- Consider adding field-level validation status details
- Implement more sophisticated progress tracking
- Add animated transitions for status changes
- Include dynamic help content based on validation errors
- Consider adding a "complete all required fields" shortcut
