# Confirmation Step Summary Content

## Objective
Create a confirmation summary component that provides users with all necessary registration information, digital artifacts, and next steps after successful registration.

## Implementation Analysis
After examining the current implementation, I found that:

1. The confirmation step uses a OneColumnStepLayout with comprehensive information
2. It includes tabs for different types of information (confirmation, tickets, details)
3. It provides rich functionality like ticket downloads, calendar integration, etc.
4. The layout is well-designed and offers a satisfying completion experience

## Implementation Decision
I've created a SimpleConfirmationSummary component that:
- Shows confirmation number prominently
- Displays registration summary information
- Includes key event details
- Provides quick action buttons

However, I recommend maintaining the current OneColumnStepLayout for the confirmation step because:
1. The existing implementation provides a comprehensive and engaging end-to-registration experience
2. It includes rich functionality that would be difficult to condense into a sidebar
3. The tabbed layout offers clear organization of different types of information
4. The confirmation step is the final step and doesn't need the same two-column layout as intermediate steps

## Component Structure
The SimpleConfirmationSummary component includes:
- Prominent confirmation number
- Registration summary (attendee counts)
- Event details (date, time, location)
- Quick action buttons for common post-registration tasks

## Potential Enhancements
If the confirmation step is redesigned:
1. Consider a hybrid approach where some information is in the main column and other info is in the sidebar
2. QR codes or barcodes could be moved to the sidebar for quick access
3. The sidebar could offer a simplified way to access additional information in the main view
4. Add more visual elements to enhance the feeling of completion

## Notes
The confirmation step is a crucial part of the user experience that affects how users feel about the entire registration process. Any changes should be carefully considered to ensure they enhance rather than detract from the current well-designed experience.
