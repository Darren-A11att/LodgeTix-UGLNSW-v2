# Performance Optimization for Summary Column

## Objective
Optimize the performance of all summary column components to ensure they render quickly, update efficiently, and maintain smooth interactions even with complex data.

## Tasks
1. Implement memoization for summary components
2. Create efficient rendering strategies for lists
3. Optimize state updates and re-renders
4. Add loading states and content placeholders

## Implementation Details
- Component memoization:
  - React.memo for pure components
  - useMemo for expensive calculations
  - useCallback for stable callback references
  - Custom equality checks for complex props
  
- Efficient list rendering:
  - Virtualized lists for large attendee/ticket data
  - Keyed list items with stable identifiers
  - Pagination for very large datasets
  - Optimized list item components
  
- State update optimization:
  - Granular state updates to minimize re-renders
  - Batched state updates where appropriate
  - Selector optimization for Zustand store
  - Throttling/debouncing for frequent updates
  
- Loading states:
  - Content skeletons for initial loading
  - Progressive loading for complex components
  - Optimistic UI updates for common actions
  - Low-priority rendering for non-critical elements

## Visual Elements
- Skeleton loaders for content
- Progressive disclosure animations
- Optimistic UI update indicators
- Lazy-loaded section placeholders
- Transition animations for state changes

## Dependencies
- React performance measurement tools
- Virtualization libraries
- Memoization utilities
- UI components for loading states

## Technical Notes
- Measure and benchmark component performance
- Identify and fix unnecessary re-renders
- Use React DevTools profiler for optimization
- Consider code splitting for large components
- Implement lazy loading for non-critical content
- Use web workers for expensive calculations
- Optimize network requests for dynamic content
