# PRD: Registration Completion Status Fix

## Problem Statement

When users completed individual registrations through the payment flow, they were encountering issues on the confirmation page where their registration data could not be found in the database. The system was falling back to localStorage data instead of displaying server-side data, indicating a disconnect between the payment completion process and the database state.

### Root Cause Analysis

The investigation revealed that the registration completion flow had a critical gap:

1. ‚úÖ User completes payment successfully
2. ‚úÖ Payment intent is created and confirmed with Stripe
3. ‚úÖ Registration gets assigned a confirmation number (e.g., `INDV-490A8E2C`)
4. ‚ùå **Missing**: Registration status was never updated to 'completed'
5. ‚úÖ User redirects to confirmation page
6. ‚ùå **Failure**: Confirmation page tries to fetch from `individuals_registration_confirmation_view`
7. ‚ùå **Root Issue**: Database view filters require `payment_status = 'completed' OR status = 'completed'`
8. ‚úÖ **Fallback**: System uses localStorage data instead

### Database View Constraint

The `registration_confirmation_base_view` has this filter condition:

```sql
WHERE r.confirmation_number IS NOT NULL
  AND (r.payment_status = 'completed' OR r.status = 'completed');
```

Registrations were getting confirmation numbers but not being marked as completed, so they were invisible to the confirmation views.

## Solution Overview

Implement a comprehensive registration completion flow that ensures all payment-related data is properly stored in the database when payment succeeds.

### Architecture Changes

1. **New PATCH Endpoint**: `/api/registrations/[id]` 
2. **Enhanced Payment Flow**: Frontend calls completion API after payment
3. **Automatic Data Enrichment**: Server automatically fetches and stores connected account data
4. **Consistent Authentication**: Uses same dual auth pattern as other payment APIs

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Registration Update API Endpoint

**File**: `/app/api/registrations/[id]/route.ts`

**New Method**: `PATCH`

**Features**:
- Dual authentication pattern (Authorization header + cookie fallback)
- Ownership verification (user must own the registration)
- Automatic connected account ID fetching for completion updates
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

**Request Format**:
```typescript
PATCH /api/registrations/{registrationId}
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer {token} // Optional, falls back to cookies

{
  "status": "completed",
  "payment_status": "completed", 
  "stripe_payment_intent_id": "pi_xxxxx",
  "payment_intent_id": "pi_xxxxx",
  "payment_confirmed_at": "2025-06-16T06:13:03.000Z",
  "total_amount_paid": 145.57,
  "stripe_fee": 5.57
}
```

**Response Format**:
```typescript
{
  "success": true,
  "registration": {
    // Updated registration object
  }
}
```

**Automatic Data Enhancement**:
When `status` or `payment_status` is set to 'completed', the API automatically:

1. Fetches the function's organizer data
2. Retrieves the `stripe_onbehalfof` connected account ID
3. Adds `connected_account_id` to the update data

```sql
-- Automatic query executed for completion updates
SELECT 
  function_id,
  functions!inner (
    organiser_id,
    organisations!inner (
      stripe_onbehalfof
    )
  )
FROM registrations 
WHERE registration_id = $1
```

### 2. Enhanced Payment Flow

**File**: `/components/register/RegistrationWizard/Steps/payment-step.tsx`

**Addition**: Post-payment completion call

**Flow Enhancement**:
```typescript
// After successful payment and confirmation number generation
console.log("üîÑ Updating registration status to completed...");

const updateResponse = await fetch(`/api/registrations/${registrationId}`, {
  method: 'PATCH',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': session?.access_token ? `Bearer ${session.access_token}` : undefined
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    status: 'completed',
    payment_status: 'completed',
    stripe_payment_intent_id: result.paymentIntentId,
    payment_intent_id: result.paymentIntentId,
    payment_confirmed_at: new Date().toISOString(),
    total_amount_paid: result.totalAmount,
    stripe_fee: result.processingFees
  })
});

if (updateResponse.ok) {
  console.log("‚úÖ Registration status updated to completed");
} else {
  console.warn("‚ö†Ô∏è Failed to update registration status, but proceeding with confirmation");
}
```

**Error Handling**: Non-blocking - if the update fails, the user still proceeds to confirmation page using localStorage data.

### 3. Database Fields Updated

When a registration is marked as completed, the following fields are populated:

| Field | Description | Source |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `status` | Overall registration status | Frontend request |
| `payment_status` | Payment completion status | Frontend request |
| `stripe_payment_intent_id` | Stripe payment intent ID | Frontend request |
| `payment_intent_id` | Duplicate for compatibility | Frontend request |
| `payment_confirmed_at` | Payment confirmation timestamp | Frontend request |
| `total_amount_paid` | Total amount charged to customer | Frontend request |
| `stripe_fee` | Stripe processing fees | Frontend request |
| `connected_account_id` | Stripe connected account ID | **Auto-fetched by API** |
| `updated_at` | Last update timestamp | **Auto-set by API** |

### 4. Authentication Pattern

The PATCH endpoint uses the same dual authentication pattern as other payment-related endpoints:

```typescript
// Try Authorization header first (for payment flow consistency)
if (authHeader) {
  const result = await createClientWithToken(authHeader);
  supabase = result.supabase;
  user = result.user;
}

// Fall back to cookie-based authentication
if (!user) {
  supabase = await createClient();
  const { data: { user: cookieUser } } = await supabase.auth.getUser();
  user = cookieUser;
}
```

This ensures compatibility with both:
- Anonymous users (using session cookies)
- Authenticated users (using bearer tokens)

```

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

**File**: `/__tests__/api/registrations/registration-update.test.ts`

Test scenarios:
- ‚úÖ PATCH with valid registration ID and user ownership
- ‚úÖ PATCH with completion data auto-fetches connected account ID
- ‚ùå PATCH with invalid registration ID returns 404
- ‚ùå PATCH with wrong user ownership returns 403
- ‚ùå PATCH without authentication returns 401
- ‚úÖ PATCH with partial data (non-completion) works normally

### Integration Tests

**File**: `/__tests__/api/registrations/payment-completion-flow.test.ts`

End-to-end scenarios:
- ‚úÖ Complete payment flow updates all required fields
- ‚úÖ Confirmation page can find completed registrations
- ‚úÖ Database view returns data for completed registrations
- ‚úÖ Connected account ID is correctly populated

### Manual Testing Checklist

- [ ] Create a new individual registration
- [ ] Complete payment successfully  
- [ ] Verify registration status is 'completed' in database
- [ ] Verify `stripe_payment_intent_id` is populated
- [ ] Verify `connected_account_id` is populated
- [ ] Verify confirmation page loads server data (not localStorage)
- [ ] Verify confirmation email is sent
- [ ] Test with both anonymous and authenticated users

## Monitoring and Observability

### Logging Enhancements

**Payment Step Logs**:
```
üîÑ Updating registration status to completed...
‚úÖ Registration status updated to completed
‚ö†Ô∏è Failed to update registration status, but proceeding with confirmation
```

**API Endpoint Logs**:
```
üìù Update Registration Status
Registration ID: 490a8e2c-c406-411c-81c5-d4f8ae3176c2
Update data: { status: "completed", payment_status: "completed", ... }
Update API - Auth header present: true
Update API - Authenticated user: 3010c770-acf4-4e68-979f-9ff3cd7cb356
Fetching organization data for completion update
Added connected_account_id: acct_xxxxx
Registration updated successfully
```

### Key Metrics to Monitor

1. **Registration Completion Rate**: Percentage of payments that result in completed status
2. **API Error Rate**: Failed PATCH requests to registration endpoint
3. **Confirmation Page Fallback Rate**: How often localStorage is used vs server data
4. **Connected Account Population Rate**: Percentage of completions with valid connected account ID

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, the system gracefully degrades:

1. **Frontend Error**: If PATCH request fails, user still sees confirmation page via localStorage
2. **API Error**: Error is logged but doesn't block user flow
3. **Database Error**: Registration remains in pending state, admin can manually complete

**Emergency Rollback**: Comment out the PATCH call in payment-step.tsx to restore previous behavior.

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2: Webhook Validation
- Add Stripe webhook endpoint to validate payment completion
- Cross-reference webhook data with database state
- Handle delayed or failed payment confirmations

### Phase 3: Audit Trail
- Add registration status change history table
- Track all status transitions with timestamps and reasons
- Enable better debugging and customer support

### Phase 4: Retry Mechanism
- Implement retry logic for failed completion updates
- Background job to process incomplete registrations
- Automated reconciliation with Stripe payment data
