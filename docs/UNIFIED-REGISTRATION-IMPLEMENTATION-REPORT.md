# Unified Registration & Payment Flow - Implementation Report

## Executive Summary

Successfully implemented a unified registration and payment system that fixes the critical $16.73 Stripe overpayment issue. The solution ensures connected accounts receive exactly the ticket subtotal amount with zero overpayment.

## Key Achievements

### 1. Fixed $16.73 Overpayment Issue ✅
- **Root Cause**: Lodge registration route was calculating transfer as `amount - applicationFeeAmount`
- **Solution**: Unified payment service ensures `transfer_data.amount = subtotal`
- **Result**: Connected accounts receive exactly what they sold tickets for

### 2. Created Unified Payment Service ✅
- Single source of truth for all payment calculations
- Consistent fee handling across all registration types
- Comprehensive metadata structure with function details
- Location: `/lib/services/unified-payment-service.ts`

### 3. Enhanced Registration Flow ✅
- Extended existing individuals endpoint to handle ALL registration types
- Maintains successful patterns while adding lodge and delegation support
- Type-safe branching logic for different registration flows
- Location: `/app/api/registrations/individuals/route.ts`

### 4. Implemented Single Source of Truth Pattern ✅
- Webhook is the ONLY place that updates status to 'completed'
- Removed redundant status updates from payment route
- Eliminated race conditions and duplicate updates
- Location: `/app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts`

### 5. Created Supporting Infrastructure ✅
- **Confirmation Polling**: `/app/api/registrations/[id]/confirmation/route.ts`
- **Metadata Updates**: `/app/api/stripe/update-metadata/route.ts`
- **Unified Payment Intent**: `/app/api/payments/create-intent/route.ts`

## Technical Details

### Payment Flow Architecture
```
1. Registration Creation → 2. Payment Intent → 3. Stripe Processing → 4. Webhook Completion
                                    ↓
                          Unified Payment Service
                           (Consistent Calculations)
```

### Fee Calculation Formula
```typescript
// Platform fee (2% capped at $20)
platformFee = Math.min(subtotal * 0.02, 20)

// Customer payment calculation
customerPayment = (subtotal + platformFee + stripeFixedFee) / (1 - stripePercentageFee)

// CRITICAL: Connected account receives exact subtotal
transfer_data.amount = subtotal
```

### Test Results
All test scenarios show $0.00 overpayment:
- Lodge Registration ($1150): ✅ $0.00 overpayment
- Individual Registration ($500): ✅ $0.00 overpayment  
- Delegation Registration ($2000): ✅ $0.00 overpayment
- Large Registration ($5000): ✅ $0.00 overpayment

## Implementation Status

| Phase 5 | ✅ Completed | Comprehensive testing and validation |
| Phase 6 | ⏳ Pending | Production deployment |

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
1. `/lib/services/unified-payment-service.ts` - Core payment logic
2. `/app/api/payments/create-intent/route.ts` - Unified payment endpoint
3. `/app/api/registrations/[id]/confirmation/route.ts` - Confirmation polling
4. `/app/api/stripe/update-metadata/route.ts` - Metadata updates
5. Test scripts for validation

### Modified Files
1. `/app/api/registrations/individuals/route.ts` - Enhanced for all types
2. `/app/api/registrations/[id]/payment/route.ts` - Removed redundant operations
3. `/app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts` - Enhanced as single source of truth

## Next Steps

### Phase 4: Frontend Updates (Medium Priority)
1. Update payment components to use `/api/payments/create-intent`
2. Implement confirmation polling after payment
3. Update metadata after confirmation generation
4. Test all registration type flows in UI

### Phase 6: Production Deployment (Low Priority)
1. Deploy backend changes
2. Monitor Stripe webhook logs
3. Verify zero overpayment in production
4. Monitor confirmation generation timing

## Conclusion

The unified registration and payment flow is fully implemented and tested on the backend. The critical $16.73 overpayment issue has been resolved, ensuring connected accounts receive exactly the ticket subtotal amount. The system is ready for frontend integration and production deployment.
