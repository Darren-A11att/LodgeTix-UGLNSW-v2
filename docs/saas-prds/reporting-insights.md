- Factors include: recency of attendance (40%), frequency of participation (30%), variety of events attended (20%), and spending trends (10%)
- Members with no activity for 12+ months automatically receive a score of 0

### 3. Report Generation Rules

**Rule 3.1: Data Freshness Requirements**
- Real-time dashboards must show data no older than 15 minutes

- Calculation alerts trigger when automated metric calculations fail or produce anomalous results
- Report generation alerts trigger when scheduled reports fail to generate or deliver

### 5. Goal Tracking Rules

**Rule 5.1: Goal Progress Calculation**
- Progress is calculated as (Current Value - Baseline Value) / (Target Value - Baseline Value) * 100
- Goals with target dates in the past automatically change status to "overdue"
- Goals achieving 100% progress automatically change status to "completed"

**Rule 5.2: Benchmark Comparison Rules**
- Performance is rated as "Below Expectations" (< 80% of benchmark), "Meeting Expectations" (80-120% of benchmark), or "Exceeding Expectations" (> 120% of benchmark)
- Industry benchmarks take precedence over organizational benchmarks for external reporting
- Seasonal adjustments are mandatory for events with >30% seasonal variance in historical data
