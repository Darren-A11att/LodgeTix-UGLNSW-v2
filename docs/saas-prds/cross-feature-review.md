## Detailed Analysis

### 1. Data Model Consistency Issues

#### 1.1 CRITICAL: Overlapping Table Definitions

**Problem**: Multiple PRDs define similar or overlapping database tables that could cause conflicts.

**Affected Features**: 
- Registrations, Check-in & Badging, Attendee Management, Vendor Management, Expense Finance

**Specific Conflicts**:

1. **Customer/Attendee Data Models**:
   - Registrations PRD: `MasonAttendee`, `PartnerAttendee`, `GuestAttendee` interfaces
   - Check-in PRD: `attendees` table references
   - Attendee Management: `attendees` table usage
   - **Conflict**: Different interface definitions for same entities

2. **Communication Tables**:
   - Attendee Management: `communication_logs`, `email_templates` tables
   - Event Marketing: Email campaign functionality implied
   - **Conflict**: Duplicate communication infrastructure

3. **Payment Processing**:
   - Registrations: `PaymentTransaction` interface with Square integration
   - Sponsorship: `sponsorship_payments` table with Square integration
   - Expense Finance: Payment processing integration
   - **Conflict**: Multiple payment processing implementations

**Recommendation**: Create unified data models document defining canonical table structures.

#### 1.2 MEDIUM: Analytics Data Duplication

**Problem**: Multiple features generate similar analytics and metrics.

**Affected Features**: Reporting & Insights, Event Marketing, Sponsorship Management

**Specific Issues**:
- Event performance metrics calculated in multiple places
- Customer engagement scoring duplicated
- Revenue analytics scattered across features

**Recommendation**: Centralize analytics in Reporting & Insights feature with other features consuming standardized metrics.

### 2. Integration Point Analysis

#### 2.1 Payment Processing Integration

**Strengths**:
- All features consistently use Square as primary payment processor
- Webhook-based architecture for real-time updates
- Fee transparency maintained across all payment flows

**Issues**:
- Registrations PRD: Uses `unified-square-payment-service.ts`
- Sponsorship PRD: Extends existing Square infrastructure
- Expense Finance PRD: Integrates with Square/Stripe (inconsistent)

**Recommendation**: Standardize on Square exclusively and define single payment service interface.

#### 2.2 Email Communication System

**Strengths**:
- Consistent use of Supabase Edge Functions for email delivery
- Template-based approach across features
- Unsubscribe management consideration

**Issues**:
- Attendee Management: Defines comprehensive email campaign system
- Event Marketing: Implies email marketing capabilities
- Check-in & Badging: Basic notification emails
- Vendor Management: Communication workflows

**Recommendation**: Make Attendee Management the single source of truth for all email communications.

#### 2.3 User Authentication & Authorization

**Strengths**:
- Consistent use of Supabase Auth across all features
- Role-based access control patterns
- Organization-scoped data access

**Issues**:
- Different role definitions across features
- Inconsistent permission granularity
- Vendor Management introduces new user types

**Recommendation**: Create unified role/permission matrix defining access across all features.

### 3. User Experience Consistency

#### 3.1 Navigation & Interface Patterns

**Issues Identified**:
1. **Inconsistent Navigation Patterns**:
   - Some PRDs specify dedicated sections (Vendor Management, Expense Finance)
   - Others integrate into existing event management flow
   - No unified navigation hierarchy defined

2. **Dashboard Fragmentation**:
   - Reporting & Insights: Comprehensive analytics dashboard
   - Check-in & Badging: Real-time attendance dashboard
   - Vendor Management: Performance dashboard
   - **Risk**: Multiple disconnected dashboards confusing users

3. **Mobile Experience Gaps**:
   - Check-in & Badging: Mobile-first PWA design
   - Other features: Desktop-centric with mobile responsiveness
   - **Inconsistency**: Different mobile experience quality

**Recommendation**: Create unified UX guidelines with consistent navigation, dashboard integration, and mobile standards.

### 4. Business Logic Alignment

#### 4.1 Event Lifecycle Integration

**Strengths**:
- All features properly integrate with event creation/management workflow
- Consistent event-to-feature relationship patterns
- Timeline-based automation (pre-event, during event, post-event)

**Well-Aligned Workflows**:
1. **Pre-Event**: Registration → Marketing → Vendor Management → Check-in Setup
2. **During Event**: Check-in → Real-time Analytics → Emergency Communications
3. **Post-Event**: Feedback Collection → Performance Analysis → Financial Reconciliation

#### 4.2 Data Flow Dependencies

**Critical Path Identified**:
```
Registration Completion → Attendee Data → Communication Segmentation → Marketing Analytics
                      ↓
               Check-in QR Generation → Badge Printing → Attendance Tracking
                      ↓
              Revenue Recognition → Financial Reporting → ROI Analysis
```

**Dependency Issues**:
- Vendor Management dietary requirements need Registration completion
- Printed Materials need finalized attendee data
- Financial reporting depends on all revenue sources

### 5. Technical Architecture Consistency

#### 5.1 Technology Stack Alignment

**Excellent Consistency**:
- **Frontend**: Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS across all features
- **Backend**: Supabase (database, auth, edge functions)
- **Payments**: Square integration (with noted Stripe inconsistency)
- **Storage**: Supabase storage buckets

#### 5.2 API Design Patterns

**Strengths**:
- RESTful API design patterns
- UUID-based entity identification
- Consistent error handling approaches

**Issues**:
- Different API endpoint naming conventions
- Inconsistent request/response schemas
- Varying authentication patterns

### 6. Feature-Specific Integration Requirements

- UserManagementService (roles/permissions)
- DocumentService (unified file handling)
```

### 2. Event-Driven Architecture

Implement event-driven integration between features:

```typescript
// Example event flow
RegistrationCompleted → [
  GenerateQRCodes (Check-in),
  UpdateAnalytics (Reporting),
  TriggerWelcomeEmail (Communication),
  UpdateDietaryRequirements (Vendor Management)
]
```

### 3. Shared Data Layer

Consolidate overlapping data requirements:

```sql
-- Core shared tables
- unified_customers (all attendee/customer data)
- communication_logs (all email/SMS activity)
- payment_transactions (all payment processing)
- analytics_events (all feature metrics)
```
