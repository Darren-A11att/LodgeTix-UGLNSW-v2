# Database Migration DB-001 through DB-008 Complete

## Migration Summary

This document confirms the successful creation of database migrations DB-001 through DB-008 for the critical architectural change from parent-child events to functions-based architecture.

## Migration Files Created

All migration files have been created in the `supabase/migrations/` directory with proper timestamps:

1. **20250601132457_db_001_create_functions_table.sql**
   - Creates the new `functions` table
   - Adds necessary indexes for performance
   - Includes update trigger for `updated_at` column

2. **20250601132458_db_002_add_function_references.sql**
   - Adds `function_id` column to `events` table
   - Adds `function_id` column to `registrations` table
   - Adds `function_id` column to `packages` table
   - Creates indexes on all new columns

3. **20250601132459_db_003_migrate_parent_events_to_functions.sql**
   - Migrates all parent events to the functions table
   - Handles both parent events with children and standalone events
   - Preserves original event data in metadata

4. **20250601132500_db_004_update_all_event_references.sql**
   - Updates all events with their corresponding function_id
   - Handles parent events, child events, and standalone events
   - Includes comprehensive validation

5. **20250601132501_db_005_update_registrations_to_functions.sql**
   - Updates all registrations to reference functions
   - Handles various edge cases for registration-event relationships
   - Provides detailed logging for orphaned registrations

6. **20250601132502_db_006_update_packages_to_functions.sql**
   - Migrates packages from parent_event_id to function_id
   - Handles packages linked through various relationships
   - Ensures no packages are left without function references

7. **20250601132503_db_007_make_function_references_required.sql**
   - Makes function_id NOT NULL on events and packages tables
   - Handles registrations carefully to avoid issues with orphaned data
   - Includes safety checks before altering constraints

8. **20250601132504_db_008_drop_legacy_columns_and_constraints.sql**
   - Backs up legacy relationships to metadata before dropping
   - Drops parent_event_id from events table
   - Drops event_id from registrations table
   - Drops parent_event_id from packages table
   - Removes all related constraints and indexes

## Key Features of the Migration

### Data Preservation
- All legacy relationships are preserved in metadata fields
- Original event IDs are stored for reference
- No data is lost during the migration

### Validation at Each Step
- Each migration includes validation queries
- Detailed logging of migration progress
- Exception handling for critical failures

### One-Way Migration
- This is a permanent architectural change
- No backward compatibility is maintained
- All parent-child relationships are replaced with function-based organization

## Testing Scripts Created

1. **test-database-migration-state.ts**
   - Pre-migration validation script
   - Checks current database state
   - Verifies readiness for migration

2. **validate-database-migration.ts**
   - Post-migration validation script
   - Comprehensive checks of all migration steps
   - Provides detailed status report

## Execution Instructions

To run these migrations:

```bash
# 1. Backup the database first
supabase db dump > backup_before_functions_migration.sql

# 2. Run migrations in sequence
supabase db push

# 3. Validate the migration
npm run scripts/validate-database-migration.ts
```

## Post-Migration Tasks

After running DB-001 through DB-008, the following tasks remain:

1. **DB-009**: Update RPC Functions for Functions Architecture
2. **DB-010**: Create New Views for Functions
3. **DB-011**: Run Data Validation Queries
4. **DB-012**: Update Permissions and RLS

## Important Notes

- **This is a one-way migration** - there is no rollback path
- All application code must be updated to use `function_id` instead of `parent_event_id`
- Registrations now link directly to functions, not events
- The event hierarchy is now flat - all events belong to a function

## Validation Checklist

After running the migrations, verify:

- [ ] Functions table exists with data
- [ ] All events have function_id (NOT NULL)
- [ ] All packages have function_id (NOT NULL)
- [ ] Most registrations have function_id
- [ ] parent_event_id column no longer exists in events
- [ ] event_id column no longer exists in registrations
- [ ] parent_event_id column no longer exists in packages

## Migration Status

âœ… **DB-001 through DB-008 Complete**

All migration files have been created and are ready for execution. The migration includes comprehensive validation and error handling to ensure a successful transition to the functions-based architecture.
