# Step 9: CI/CD Pipeline Integration

## Objective
Integrate Puppeteer tests with the existing CI/CD pipeline while maintaining compatibility with current Playwright tests.

## Tasks

### 9.1 Pipeline Configuration
- [ ] Update GitHub Actions workflow
- [ ] Configure parallel test execution
- [ ] Set up browser caching
- [ ] Implement test sharding

### 9.2 Test Execution Strategy
- [ ] Create separate test jobs
- [ ] Configure test matrix
- [ ] Set up conditional execution
- [ ] Implement fail-fast strategy

### 9.3 Reporting Integration
- [ ] Unify test report formats
- [ ] Set up artifact storage
- [ ] Configure test result notifications
- [ ] Implement coverage reporting

### 9.4 Performance Optimization
- [ ] Optimize browser startup
- [ ] Configure resource limits
- [ ] Implement test parallelization
- [ ] Set up caching strategies

## GitHub Actions Configuration

### Updated Workflow
```yaml
name: E2E Tests
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  playwright-tests:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Run Playwright tests
        run: npm run test:playwright

  puppeteer-tests:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Setup Puppeteer
        run: |
          npm ci
          npx puppeteer browsers install chrome
      - name: Run Puppeteer tests
        run: npm run test:puppeteer

  test-report:
    needs: [playwright-tests, puppeteer-tests]
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Merge test reports
        run: npm run test:report:merge
```

### Test Scripts
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test:playwright": "playwright test",
    "test:puppeteer": "jest --config=jest.puppeteer.config.js",
    "test:all": "npm run test:playwright && npm run test:puppeteer",
    "test:report:merge": "node scripts/merge-test-reports.js"
  }
}
```

## Expected Outputs
- Updated CI/CD configuration
- Unified test reporting
- Performance benchmarks
- Deployment documentation

## Success Criteria
- All tests run in CI/CD
- No increase in pipeline time
- Clear test result visibility
- Reliable test execution
