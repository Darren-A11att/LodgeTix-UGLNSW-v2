# Database Integration Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the TODO items for integrating the LodgeTix application with the cleaned-up database schema. The goal is to optimize API calls, fix naming inconsistencies, and implement efficient data access patterns.

## Implementation Priority Order

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes (Week 1)
1. **TODO-01**: Update code field names to match database
   - Fix customer_id → contact_id references
   - Update organization → organisation spelling
   - Critical for all queries to work

2. **TODO-09**: Update TypeScript definitions
   - Generate new types from database
   - Fix type mismatches
   - Essential for type safety

### Phase 2: Performance Optimization (Week 2)
3. **TODO-02**: Create database views
   - event_display_view for efficient event queries
   - registration_detail_view for complete registration data
   - Reduces multiple API calls to single queries

4. **TODO-03**: Create RPC functions
   - Complex operations like eligibility checking
   - Atomic operations for registration/payment
   - Business logic in database

5. **TODO-10**: Add performance indexes
   - Critical for query performance
   - Must be done before going live

### Phase 3: Feature Implementation (Week 3)
6. **TODO-04**: Create data adapters
   - Handle naming differences gracefully
   - Transform data for UI consumption
   - Backward compatibility layer

7. **TODO-05**: Optimize API calls
   - Implement caching strategy
   - Batch operations
   - Reduce redundant calls

8. **TODO-08**: Implement real-time updates
   - Ticket availability subscriptions
   - Connection management
   - UI updates

### Phase 4: Storage & Completeness (Week 4)
9. **TODO-06**: Implement storage strategy
   - QR code generation and storage
   - PDF generation for confirmations
   - Email tracking

10. **TODO-07**: Add missing database fields
    - Non-critical missing fields
    - Email tracking tables
    - Document storage references

## Key Principles

### 1. Minimize API Calls
- Use views to get complete data in one query
- Use RPC functions for complex operations
- Cache static data aggressively

### 2. Maintain Type Safety
- Keep TypeScript definitions in sync
- Use type guards and validation
- Generate types from database schema

### 3. Performance First
- Add indexes before deployment
- Monitor query performance
- Use database for heavy lifting

### 4. Incremental Migration
- Use adapters for backward compatibility
- Migrate gradually, test thoroughly
- Keep old code working during transition

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All field name mismatches resolved
- [ ] API calls reduced by 50%
- [ ] Page load times under 2 seconds
- [ ] Zero type errors in production
- [ ] Real-time updates working smoothly

## Risk Mitigation
- Test each phase thoroughly
- Have rollback plans ready
- Monitor performance metrics
- Keep detailed migration logs

## Next Steps
1. Review and prioritize TODOs with team
2. Assign developers to each phase
3. Set up development environment
4. Create detailed timelines
5. Begin Phase 1 implementation
