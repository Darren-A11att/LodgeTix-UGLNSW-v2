# RLS Security Fixes - What Changed

## Critical Security Issues Fixed

### ❌ WRONG: Version 1 (Security Vulnerability)
The original policies had severe security issues where anonymous users could potentially:
- Insert, update, or delete events
- Modify other users' data
- Access private information

### ✅ CORRECT: Version 2 (Secure)
The fixed policies properly restrict anonymous users to:
- ONLY view published events and public data
- ONLY create registrations and contacts for guest checkout
- NO ability to modify or delete anything

## Key Changes by Table

### Events Table
| Operation | Version 1 (Wrong) | Version 2 (Correct) |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------------|
| SELECT | ✅ Anon: published only | ✅ Anon: published only |
| INSERT | ❌ Applied to anon | ✅ Auth only (organizers) |
| UPDATE | ❌ Applied to anon | ✅ Auth only (organizers) |
| DELETE | ❌ Applied to anon | ✅ Auth only (organizers) |

### Registrations Table
| Operation | Version 1 (Wrong) | Version 2 (Correct) |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------------|
| SELECT | ❌ No anon policy | ✅ Auth only (own data) |
| INSERT | ✅ Anon allowed | ✅ Anon allowed (guest checkout) |
| UPDATE | ❌ Could be misused | ✅ Auth only (pending payments) |
| DELETE | ❌ Not defined | ✅ Not allowed |

### Critical Security Principles Applied

1. **Explicit Role Targeting**
   - Before: Policies with `TO authenticated` showing as "Applies to anonymous"
   - After: Separate policies for each role with explicit `TO anon` or `TO authenticated`

2. **Minimal Anonymous Access**
   - Before: Unclear/excessive permissions
   - After: Anonymous can ONLY read public data and create guest registrations

3. **Payment Status Enforcement**
   - Before: Used invalid 'processing' status
   - After: Only 'pending' status allows modifications

4. **Organizer Verification**
   - Before: Basic organization check
   - After: Checks both organization membership AND user role

## Implementation Checklist

1. ✅ Drop all existing insecure policies
2. ✅ Apply helper functions first
3. ✅ Apply new secure policies
4. ✅ Test each role thoroughly:
   - Anonymous: Can only read public + create guest checkout
   - Authenticated: Can manage own data only
   - Organizers: Can manage their events
5. ✅ Verify no elevated permissions for anonymous users

## Testing Commands

```sql
-- Test anonymous access (should fail for most operations)
SET ROLE anon;
INSERT INTO events (title) VALUES ('Hack'); -- Should FAIL
UPDATE events SET title = 'Hacked'; -- Should FAIL
DELETE FROM events; -- Should FAIL

-- Test authenticated access (should work for own data)
SET ROLE authenticated;
SET request.jwt.claims ->> 'sub' = 'your-user-id';
SELECT * FROM registrations; -- Should show only your data
UPDATE registrations SET ... WHERE payment_status = 'pending'; -- Should work
UPDATE registrations SET ... WHERE payment_status = 'completed'; -- Should FAIL
```

## Why This Matters

The original policies could have allowed:
- 🚨 Data breaches (viewing others' personal info)
- 🚨 Data manipulation (changing event details)
- 🚨 Financial fraud (modifying payment amounts)
- 🚨 System abuse (creating fake events)

The new policies ensure:
- ✅ Data privacy (users see only their data)
- ✅ Data integrity (no unauthorized modifications)
- ✅ System security (proper role-based access)
- ✅ Compliance (data protection requirements)
