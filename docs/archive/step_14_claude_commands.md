# Step 14: Claude Code Commands for Daily Use

## Objective
Document and implement Claude Code commands that the team can use daily for efficient test development and maintenance with Puppeteer.

## Tasks

### 14.1 Test Generation Commands
- [ ] Document component test generation
- [ ] Create user flow test commands
- [ ] Build regression test generators
- [ ] Design API test commands

### 14.2 Debugging Commands
- [ ] Create selector debugging commands
- [ ] Build test failure analysis
- [ ] Implement performance profiling
- [ ] Design flaky test detection

### 14.3 Maintenance Commands
- [ ] Document test refactoring commands
- [ ] Create selector update commands
- [ ] Build test optimization commands
- [ ] Design coverage analysis

### 14.4 Reporting Commands
- [ ] Create test summary generation
- [ ] Build failure report commands
- [ ] Implement trend analysis
- [ ] Design custom report builders

## Command Categories

### 1. Test Generation Commands

#### Generate Component Test
```
Command: "Generate Puppeteer test for the RegistrationWizard component focusing on happy path"
Output: Complete test file with setup, actions, and assertions
```

#### Generate User Journey Test
```
Command: "Create end-to-end test for Mason registering for Grand Installation with partner"
Output: Full user journey test with data setup and verifications
```

#### Generate Visual Test
```
Command: "Add visual regression test for ticket selection page on mobile and desktop"
Output: Visual test with responsive breakpoints
```

### 2. Debugging Commands

#### Debug Failing Test
```
Command: "Debug why the payment form test is failing on line 45"
Output: Analysis of failure with suggested fixes
```

#### Fix Flaky Test
```
Command: "Analyze and fix flaky behavior in the lodge selection test"
Output: Root cause analysis and stabilization code
```

#### Optimize Slow Test
```
Command: "Optimize the registration flow test that takes over 30 seconds"
Output: Performance analysis and optimized test code
```

### 3. Maintenance Commands

#### Update Selectors
```
Command: "Update all selectors in payment tests to use data-testid"
Output: Refactored tests with improved selectors
```

#### Refactor to Page Objects
```
Command: "Refactor the inline selectors in attendee tests to page objects"
Output: Page object classes and updated tests
```

#### Add Error Handling
```
Command: "Add comprehensive error handling to all payment tests"
Output: Tests with try-catch blocks and meaningful errors
```

### 4. Analysis Commands

#### Coverage Analysis
```
Command: "Analyze test coverage for the registration flow"
Output: Coverage report with missing test scenarios
```

#### Performance Report
```
Command: "Generate performance comparison between old and new tests"
Output: Detailed performance metrics and graphs
```

## Daily Workflow Examples

### Morning Test Run
```bash
# Claude command sequence
"Run smoke tests and summarize any failures"
"For any failures, provide root cause analysis"
"Generate fix suggestions for failing tests"
```

### New Feature Testing
```bash
# Claude command sequence
"Analyze the new delegation feature PR"
"Generate comprehensive test suite for delegation flow"
"Add edge cases and error scenarios"
"Create visual regression tests for new UI"
```

### Test Maintenance
```bash
# Claude command sequence
"Find all tests using deprecated selectors"
"Update to use new selector strategy"
"Verify tests still pass after updates"
"Generate report of changes made"
```

## Command Templates

### Custom Command Builder
```typescript
interface ClaudeCommand {
  name: string;
  description: string;
  parameters: string[];
  example: string;
  output: string;
}

const customCommands: ClaudeCommand[] = [
  {
    name: "Generate Data-Driven Test",
    description: "Creates parameterized test from data set",
    parameters: ["test scenario", "data file path"],
    example: "Generate data-driven test for registration using test-data/users.json",
    output: "Parameterized test with data provider"
  }
];
```

## Expected Outputs
- Command reference guide
- Usage examples library
- Custom command templates
- Integration workflows

## Success Criteria
- Team uses commands daily
- 50% reduction in test writing time
- Consistent test quality
- Improved test coverage
