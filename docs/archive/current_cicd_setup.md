# Current CI/CD Setup

## Overview
LodgeTix-UGLNSW-v2 appears to use Vercel for deployment and hosting, based on the Next.js configuration and Sentry integration settings. The project does not have GitHub Actions workflows configured in the repository.

## Deployment Platform

### Vercel (Inferred)
Based on the codebase analysis:
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 (Vercel's framework)
- **Configuration**: `next.config.mjs` with Vercel-specific settings
- **Monitoring**: Sentry integration with Vercel Cron Monitors
- **Analytics**: References to Vercel in Sentry config

### Evidence of Vercel Usage
1. `automaticVercelMonitors: true` in Sentry config
2. Next.js configuration optimized for Vercel deployment
3. Environment variable patterns consistent with Vercel
4. No custom deployment scripts or Docker configuration

## Build Configuration

### Next.js Build Settings (`next.config.mjs`)

**Build Optimizations**:
```javascript
{
  eslint: {
    ignoreDuringBuilds: true,  // Skip ESLint during builds
  },
  typescript: {
    ignoreBuildErrors: true,   // Skip TypeScript errors during builds
  },
  images: {
    unoptimized: true,         // Disable image optimization
  }
}
```

**Webpack Configuration**:
- Custom chunk splitting for optimization
- Suppresses build warnings
- Separates large libraries (recharts, types)
- Performance hints disabled

### Build Commands
```json
{
  "build": "next build",
  "build:clean": "rm -rf .next && next build",
  "start": "next start"
}
```

## Environment Configuration

### Environment Variables Structure
The project uses multiple environment files:
- `.env` - Default environment variables
- `.env.local` - Local development overrides
- `.env.test` - Test environment configuration
- `.env.production` - Production environment (managed by Vercel)

### Key Environment Variables Required
- Supabase credentials
- Stripe API keys
- Cloudflare Turnstile keys
- Sentry DSN
- Application URLs

## Error Monitoring

### Sentry Integration
**Configuration**:
```javascript
{
  org: "mylodgeio-q1",
  project: "nsw-lodgtix",
  silent: !process.env.CI,
  widenClientFileUpload: true,
  disableLogger: true,
  automaticVercelMonitors: true
}
```

**Features**:
- Source map uploading
- Error tracking for client and server
- Performance monitoring
- Automatic Vercel Cron monitoring

## Testing Strategy

### Pre-deployment Testing
**Local Testing**:
```bash
# Unit tests
npm run test

# E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Type checking (manual)
npx tsc --noEmit

# Linting (manual)
npm run lint
```

**Note**: Build errors for TypeScript and ESLint are ignored during deployment, suggesting testing happens pre-commit rather than in CI/CD.

## Deployment Process

### Inferred Vercel Deployment Flow
1. **Push to Git** â†’ Triggers Vercel deployment
2. **Vercel Build**:
   - Installs dependencies
   - Runs `next build`
   - Uploads source maps to Sentry
   - Generates static assets
3. **Deployment**:
   - Deploys to Vercel edge network
   - Updates environment variables
   - Invalidates CDN cache
4. **Post-deployment**:
   - Sentry monitoring activated
   - Health checks performed

### Branch Strategy
Based on git status showing `main` branch:
- **Main Branch**: Production deployments
- **Feature Branches**: Preview deployments (Vercel default)

## Database Migrations

### Supabase Migration Strategy
**Manual Process**:
1. Migrations stored in `/supabase/migrations/`
2. Applied manually via Supabase CLI or dashboard
3. No automated migration in CI/CD pipeline

**Migration Files**:
- SQL files for schema changes
- Naming convention: `table_name.sql`
- No timestamp prefixes (manual ordering)

## Security Considerations

### Build-time Security
1. **Environment Variables**: 
   - Public keys use `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix
   - Secret keys never exposed to client
   - Managed through Vercel dashboard

2. **Dependencies**:
   - No automated security scanning configured
   - Manual dependency updates
   - Lock file committed (`bun.lock`)

### Runtime Security
1. **CSP Headers**: Managed by Vercel
2. **HTTPS**: Enforced by Vercel
3. **API Protection**: Middleware-based authentication

## Performance Optimization

### Build Optimizations
1. **Code Splitting**:
   - Automatic Next.js code splitting
   - Custom chunks for large libraries
   - Dynamic imports for heavy components

2. **Asset Optimization**:
   - CSS minification via PostCSS
   - JavaScript minification
   - Tree shaking enabled

### Caching Strategy
1. **Static Assets**: Cached at CDN edge
2. **API Responses**: No explicit caching configuration
3. **Database Queries**: No query caching layer

## Monitoring and Logging

### Application Monitoring
- **Sentry**: Error tracking and performance
- **Vercel Analytics**: Traffic and performance metrics
- **Custom Logging**: API request logging

### Health Checks
No explicit health check endpoints configured, relying on:
- Vercel's built-in monitoring
- Sentry error alerts
- Manual monitoring

## Development Workflow

### Local Development
```bash
npm run dev
# Runs on http://localhost:3000
# Hot reloading enabled
# Environment variables from .env.local
```

### Testing Workflow
```bash
# Run all tests before commit
npm run test
npm run test:e2e

# Manual type checking
npx tsc --noEmit
```

### Deployment Workflow
1. Create feature branch
2. Develop and test locally
3. Push to GitHub
4. Vercel creates preview deployment
5. Test preview deployment
6. Merge to main
7. Automatic production deployment

## Missing CI/CD Components

### Not Configured
1. **GitHub Actions**: No workflows defined
2. **Automated Testing**: Tests not run in CI
3. **Code Quality Checks**: No automated linting/formatting
4. **Security Scanning**: No dependency vulnerability checks
5. **Database Migrations**: Manual process
6. **Backup Strategy**: Not defined in code

### Recommendations for Enhancement
1. **Add GitHub Actions** for:
   - Running tests on PR
   - Type checking
   - Linting and formatting
   - Security scanning

2. **Implement Database CI/CD**:
   - Automated migration running
   - Database backup before migrations
   - Rollback procedures

3. **Add Quality Gates**:
   - Required status checks
   - Code coverage thresholds
   - Performance budgets

4. **Enhance Monitoring**:
   - Uptime monitoring
   - Performance baselines
   - Error rate alerts

## Conclusion

The current CI/CD setup is minimal, relying heavily on Vercel's automatic deployment features. While this provides a simple deployment process, it lacks automated testing, code quality checks, and database migration automation that would be expected in a production application. The build configuration prioritizes successful deployments over code quality by disabling TypeScript and ESLint errors during builds.
