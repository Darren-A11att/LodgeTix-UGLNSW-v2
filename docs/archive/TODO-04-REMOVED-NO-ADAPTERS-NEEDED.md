# TODO-04: REMOVED - No Adapters Needed

## This TODO has been removed!

After review, we've decided NOT to create adapter functions. Instead, we're taking the simpler approach of directly updating the code to match the database field names.

## Why No Adapters?
- **Unnecessary Complexity**: Adapters add a layer that doesn't provide value
- **Performance Overhead**: Every data fetch would go through transformation
- **Maintenance Burden**: Another layer to keep in sync
- **Confusion**: Developers have to remember both names

## What We're Doing Instead
See **TODO-01-UPDATE-CODE-FIELD-NAMES-REVISED.md** for the direct approach:
- Find and replace field names throughout codebase
- Update TypeScript types to match database exactly
- Remove computed fields that don't exist in database
- Calculate derived values where they're needed

## The Only "Adaptation" We Need
For fields that truly need transformation (like location display):
- Use database views to compute them
- Or calculate in the component where needed
- But NOT through an adapter layer

This keeps our codebase simple, performant, and maintainable.
