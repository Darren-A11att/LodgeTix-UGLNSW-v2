# Step 12: Gradual Migration Strategy

## Objective
Implement a phased approach to migrate existing Playwright tests to Puppeteer while maintaining test coverage and team productivity.

## Tasks

### 12.1 Migration Planning
- [ ] Prioritize tests for migration
- [ ] Create migration timeline
- [ ] Define success criteria per phase
- [ ] Establish rollback procedures

### 12.2 Phase 1: Low-Risk Tests
- [ ] Migrate smoke tests first
- [ ] Convert simple UI tests
- [ ] Validate migration process
- [ ] Document lessons learned

### 12.3 Phase 2: Feature Tests
- [ ] Migrate registration flow tests
- [ ] Convert payment flow tests
- [ ] Update ticket selection tests
- [ ] Maintain parallel execution

### 12.4 Phase 3: Complex Scenarios
- [ ] Migrate visual regression tests
- [ ] Convert end-to-end workflows
- [ ] Update performance tests
- [ ] Complete migration validation

## Migration Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
```
Target: 20% of tests
Focus: 
- Smoke tests
- Health checks
- Simple form validations
- Basic navigation tests

Success Criteria:
- Zero regression in coverage
- Migration time < 2 hours per test
- All migrated tests passing
```

### Phase 2: Core Features (Weeks 3-6)
```
Target: 50% of tests
Focus:
- Registration flows
- Payment processing
- Ticket selection
- User authentication

Success Criteria:
- Feature parity maintained
- Performance improvement > 10%
- Team comfortable with Puppeteer
```

### Phase 3: Advanced Tests (Weeks 7-10)
```
Target: 100% of tests
Focus:
- Visual regression
- Multi-step workflows
- Integration tests
- Performance tests

Success Criteria:
- Complete migration
- Reduced maintenance effort
- Improved test stability
```

## Migration Checklist
```markdown
- [ ] Identify test for migration
- [ ] Review test complexity
- [ ] Convert page objects
- [ ] Migrate test logic
- [ ] Update assertions
- [ ] Verify test passes
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Remove old test
- [ ] Update CI/CD config
```

## Risk Mitigation
- Keep both tests running initially
- Gradual deprecation of Playwright tests
- Regular team check-ins
- Continuous monitoring of test metrics

## Expected Outputs
- Detailed migration plan
- Phase completion reports
- Risk mitigation strategies
- Final migration report

## Success Criteria
- 100% test migration completed
- No loss in coverage
- Improved test execution time
- Team fully trained on Puppeteer
