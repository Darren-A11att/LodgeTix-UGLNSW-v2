# Lodge Registration Form Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Duplicate Payment Buttons
**Problem:** The lodge registration form had two payment buttons:
- One inside the Stripe CheckoutForm (correct)
- One at the bottom of the page (incorrect duplicate)

**Solution:**
- Removed the duplicate "Pay $[amount]" button at the bottom of the page
- Added a "Previous Step" back button for navigation consistency
- The only payment button is now inside the Stripe form where it belongs

### 2. Navigation Missing
**Problem:** No back button to return to registration type selection

**Solution:**
- Added navigation props to `LodgeRegistrationStepProps`
- Implemented back button with arrow icon
- Connected to registration store's `goToPrevStep` function
- Updated registration wizard to pass navigation props

### 3. Incorrect Total Amount in Stripe Form
**Problem:** Stripe form showed $0.31 while order summary showed correct amount ($1,425.24)

**Root Cause:** The `lodgeTicketOrder` in the registration store wasn't being initialized when the component mounted, resulting in a null/zero table count.

**Solution:**
- Added a `useEffect` in `LodgesForm` to initialize the store with the default package count (1) when component mounts
- This ensures the `lodgeTicketOrder` is set immediately when packages are loaded
- The total amount in the Stripe form now correctly reflects the order summary

## Updated Components

1. **LodgeRegistrationStep** (`/components/register/RegistrationWizard/Steps/LodgeRegistrationStep.tsx`)
   - Added navigation props interface
   - Removed duplicate submit button
   - Added back button navigation

2. **LodgesForm** (`/components/register/Forms/attendee/LodgesForm.tsx`)
   - Added useEffect to initialize lodge ticket order in store
   - Ensures package count is synced with store on mount

3. **Registration Wizard** (`/components/register/RegistrationWizard/registration-wizard.tsx`)
   - Updated to pass `onPrevStep` prop to LodgeRegistrationStep

## Result
- Clean UI with single payment button in the correct location
- Proper navigation with back button
- Correct total amount displayed in both order summary and Stripe payment form
- Consistent user experience with other registration steps
