# Step 1: Analyze Project Structure

## Objective
Understand the current test setup and code organization to ensure seamless integration with Claude Code's Puppeteer capabilities.

## Tasks

### 1.1 Document Current Testing Infrastructure
- [ ] Identify existing Playwright test structure in `__tests__/e2e/`
- [ ] Map page object patterns in `__tests__/e2e/page-objects/`
- [ ] Document test organization (smoke tests, flows, visual tests)
- [ ] Review test configuration in `playwright.config.ts`

### 1.2 Analyze Application Architecture
- [ ] Map key application routes and pages
- [ ] Document component structure in `/components/`
- [ ] Identify critical user flows for testing
- [ ] Review API endpoints in `/app/api/`

### 1.3 Review Test Data and Utilities
- [ ] Document test data structure in `config/test-data.ts`
- [ ] Review test utilities in `utils/test-utils.ts`
- [ ] Identify global setup requirements
- [ ] Map environment-specific configurations

### 1.4 Identify Integration Points
- [ ] List areas where Puppeteer can complement Playwright
- [ ] Document shared utilities that can be reused
- [ ] Identify potential conflicts or overlaps
- [ ] Map migration priorities

## Expected Outputs
- Project structure analysis document
- Test infrastructure mapping
- Integration points identification
- Risk assessment for Puppeteer integration

## Success Criteria
- Complete understanding of existing test setup
- Clear integration strategy identified
- No disruption to existing tests planned
- All team dependencies documented
