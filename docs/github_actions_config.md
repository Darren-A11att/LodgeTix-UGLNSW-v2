# GitHub Actions Configuration

## Current Status

**No GitHub Actions workflows are currently configured in this repository.**

The project does not have a `.github/workflows/` directory or any workflow YAML files, indicating that GitHub Actions is not being used for continuous integration or deployment.

## Deployment Method

Based on the codebase analysis:
- The project appears to use **Vercel** for deployment (as evidenced by Next.js configuration and Sentry settings)
- Deployments are likely triggered automatically by Git pushes to the repository
- No custom CI/CD workflows are defined in the repository

## Recommended GitHub Actions Workflows

While not currently implemented, here are recommended workflows that would benefit this project:

### 1. Continuous Integration Workflow

**Purpose**: Run tests and quality checks on pull requests

```yaml
name: CI
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run test
      - run: npm run test:e2e
      - run: npx tsc --noEmit
      - run: npm run lint
```

### 2. Security Scanning Workflow

**Purpose**: Scan for dependency vulnerabilities

```yaml
name: Security
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * 1'  # Weekly on Monday
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  security:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - run: npm audit
      - uses: snyk/actions/node@master
        env:
          SNYK_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SNYK_TOKEN }}
```

### 3. Database Migration Check

**Purpose**: Validate database migrations

```yaml
name: Database
on:
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - 'supabase/migrations/**'

jobs:
  migration-check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: supabase/setup-cli@v1
      - run: supabase db lint
      - run: supabase db diff --local
```

### 4. Performance Budget Check

**Purpose**: Monitor bundle size and performance metrics

```yaml
name: Performance
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  bundle-size:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run build
      - uses: preactjs/compressed-size-action@v2
        with:
          repo-token: "${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}"
```

## Implementation Steps

To add GitHub Actions to this project:

1. **Create Workflows Directory**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .github/workflows
   ```

2. **Add Workflow Files**
   - Create YAML files for each workflow
   - Configure triggers and jobs
   - Set up required secrets

3. **Configure Secrets**
   Required GitHub secrets:
   - `VERCEL_TOKEN` - For deployment notifications
   - `SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID` - For database checks
   - `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` - For error tracking
   - `SNYK_TOKEN` - For security scanning

4. **Test Workflows**
   - Create a pull request to trigger workflows
   - Monitor workflow runs
   - Adjust configurations as needed

## Benefits of GitHub Actions

### 1. Automated Testing
- Run tests on every pull request
- Catch bugs before merging
- Ensure code quality standards

### 2. Security Monitoring
- Regular vulnerability scans
- Dependency update notifications
- Security policy enforcement

### 3. Performance Tracking
- Bundle size monitoring
- Build time tracking
- Performance regression prevention

### 4. Database Safety
- Migration validation
- Schema consistency checks
- Rollback procedures

### 5. Documentation
- Automated documentation generation
- API documentation updates
- Changelog generation

## Integration with Vercel

While Vercel handles deployments, GitHub Actions can complement it by:

1. **Pre-deployment Checks**
   - Run tests before Vercel builds
   - Validate environment variables
   - Check database migrations

2. **Post-deployment Actions**
   - Smoke tests on preview URLs
   - Performance testing
   - Notification to team channels

3. **Environment Management**
   - Sync secrets between GitHub and Vercel
   - Manage environment promotions
   - Coordinate multi-service deployments

## Conclusion

The absence of GitHub Actions workflows represents an opportunity to improve the development workflow. Implementing even basic CI workflows would provide:

- Better code quality assurance
- Faster feedback on pull requests
- Reduced manual testing burden
- Improved team confidence in deployments

The project's reliance on Vercel for deployment is appropriate, but adding GitHub Actions for pre-deployment validation would create a more robust development pipeline.
