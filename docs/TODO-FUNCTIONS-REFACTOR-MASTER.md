# Functions Architecture Refactor - Master TODO List

> **Single Source of Truth**: This document serves as the authoritative guide for all refactoring tasks. All sub-agents and team members should reference and update this document.

## Overview

This master TODO list coordinates the complete refactoring from parent-child events to functions-based architecture. Tasks are organized by area of concern with clear dependencies and validation criteria.

## Task Categories

1. **[DB]** Database Schema & Migration
2. **[DM]** Data Migration Scripts  
3. **[BE]** Backend Services & APIs
4. **[FE]** Frontend Components
5. **[TS]** Testing & Validation
6. **[IF]** Infrastructure & Configuration

## Coordination Notes

- Each area will be detailed by specialized sub-agents
- All changes must maintain backward compatibility during transition
- Feature flags will control rollout
- Comprehensive testing required at each phase

## Risk Register

| Risk | Mitigation | Owner |
|------|------------|-------|
| Data integrity | Backup & validation | DBA |
| API breaking changes | Versioning | Backend |
| UI disruption | Feature flags | Frontend |

## Communication Plan

1. Daily standup on progress
2. Blocking issues escalated immediately
3. PR reviews required for all changes
4. Documentation updates concurrent with code

## Success Metrics

- [ ] Zero data loss
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Feature parity achieved
- [ ] Clean rollback possible
