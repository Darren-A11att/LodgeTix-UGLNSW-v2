  - Individual registrations continue using TwoColumnStepLayout
  - Added delegationType to component state

### 3. ✅ Enhanced GrandLodgesForm
- **File**: `/components/register/Forms/attendee/GrandLodgesForm.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Removed Lodge selection (redundant for Grand Lodges)
  - Two-tab interface: "Purchase Tickets Only" and "Register Delegation"

  - No Lodge selection (only Masonic Order selection)
  - Same two-tab structure as GrandLodgesForm
  - Updated all text references to "Masonic Order"

### 5. ✅ Implemented Delegate Management
- **Features**:
  - Mason delegate fields: Title, First Name, Last Name, Grand Rank (GKL), Grand Officer, Grand Office
  - Guest fields: Title, First Name, Last Name, Relationship, Partner Of dropdown
  - Partner handling based on how they're added (button vs icon)
  - Inline editing capabilities
  - Validation for required fields

### 6. ✅ Implemented Ticket Selection Tabs

  - Individual Tickets: Table with per-delegate ticket selection
  - Support for packages and individual tickets
  - Bulk order handling for lodges

### 7. ✅ Updated Registration Flow
- **Changes**:
  - Purchase Tickets Only option skips directly to payment step
  - Proper handling of delegation types throughout the flow
  - Summary displays show specific delegation type

## Key Components

### DelegationTypeModal
```typescript
interface DelegationType {
  lodge: 'Lodge Delegation'
  grandLodge: 'Grand Lodge Delegation'
  masonicOrder: 'Masonic Order Delegation'
}
```

### Delegate Management
```typescript
interface DelegationMember {
  id: string
  type: 'Mason' | 'Guest' | 'Partner'
  title: string
  firstName: string
  lastName: string
  grandRank?: string
  isGrandOfficer?: boolean
  grandOffice?: string
  relationship?: string
  partnerOf?: string
}
```

### Registration Store Updates
- Added `delegationType` field
- Created `setDelegationType` action
- Persisted delegation type in localStorage

## User Flow

1. User selects "Official Delegation" as registration type
2. Modal appears to select delegation subtype
3. Based on selection:
   - Lodge → LodgesForm
   - Grand Lodge → GrandLodgesForm
   - Masonic Order → MasonicOrdersForm
4. User chooses between:
   - Purchase Tickets Only → Skip to payment
   - Register Delegation → Provide delegate details
5. Ticket selection with bulk or individual options
6. Continue through payment and confirmation

## Technical Highlights

- Reused existing components where possible
- Maintained consistency with existing patterns
- Proper state management and persistence
- Responsive design with appropriate layouts
- Comprehensive validation
- Type-safe implementation

## Testing Considerations

1. Test all three delegation types
2. Verify Purchase Tickets Only flow skips to payment
3. Test delegate addition/editing/removal
4. Verify partner relationship management
5. Test ticket selection for bulk and individual scenarios
6. Ensure proper data persistence across steps

## Future Enhancements

1. Bulk import of delegates from CSV
2. Copy delegate details between registrations
3. Save delegation templates for reuse
4. Enhanced autocomplete for Grand Offices
5. More granular ticket selection options
