I'll help you analyze both tables and create a plan to ensure the `events_ticket` table is updated when tickets are created in the `tickets` table. Let me start by examining the structure of both tables.Now let me examine the structure of both tables more closely to understand their relationship and create a comprehensive plan.Based on my analysis of your database structure, I can see the relationship between the `tickets` and `event_tickets` tables. Here's what I found and my plan to ensure they stay synchronized:

## Current Situation

1. **`event_tickets` table**: Defines ticket types/categories for events (e.g., "Gold", "Silver", "Bronze" tickets)
   - Has inventory tracking columns: `total_capacity`, `available_count`, `reserved_count`, `sold_count`
   - Currently all counts show 0, indicating they're not being updated

2. **`tickets` table**: Stores actual ticket instances when someone purchases/reserves
   - Has a `ticket_type_id` column that should link to `event_tickets.id`
   - Currently this column is NULL for all tickets
   - Missing foreign key constraint to `event_tickets`

3. **`events` table**: Also has `sold_count` and `reserved_count` columns for overall event tracking

## Comprehensive Plan to Synchronize Tables

### Step 1: Add Missing Foreign Key Constraint### Step 2: Create Trigger Function to Update event_tickets Counts### Step 3: Create Trigger on tickets Table### Step 4: Create Function to Update Event-level Counts### Step 5: Create Functions to Recalculate Counts### Step 6: Initialize Data and Test## Summary of Implementation

I've successfully implemented a comprehensive synchronization system between the `tickets` and `event_tickets` tables. Here's what has been set up:

### 1. **Database Structure Improvements**
- Added foreign key constraint from `tickets.ticket_type_id` to `event_tickets.id`
- Created index on `ticket_type_id` for better performance

### 2. **Automatic Synchronization Triggers**
- **`update_event_tickets_counts_trigger`**: Automatically updates `event_tickets` counts when tickets are created, updated, or deleted
- **`update_events_counts_trigger`**: Updates overall event counts in the `events` table

### 3. **Count Management**
The system now tracks:
- **In `event_tickets` table**: `available_count`, `reserved_count`, `sold_count` for each ticket type
- **In `events` table**: Overall `reserved_count` and `sold_count` for the entire event

### 4. **Helper Functions Created**
- `recalculate_event_ticket_counts()`: Recalculates all event_ticket counts from scratch
- `recalculate_event_counts()`: Recalculates all event counts from scratch
- `initialize_event_ticket_availability()`: Sets initial available counts

## How to Use Going Forward

### When Creating New Tickets
You **MUST** specify the `ticket_type_id` to link tickets to their ticket type:

```sql
INSERT INTO tickets (
    attendee_id, 
    event_id, 
    ticket_type_id,  -- This is now required!
    price_paid, 
    status
) VALUES (
    'attendee-uuid',
    'event-uuid', 
    'event-ticket-type-uuid',  -- From event_tickets.id
    150.00,
    'reserved'
);
```

### Status Transitions
The system automatically handles these status transitions:
- `reserved` → `sold`: Decrements reserved, increments sold
- `sold` → `reserved`: Decrements sold, increments reserved  
- `reserved/sold` → `cancelled`: Returns ticket to available pool
- `cancelled/available` → `reserved/sold`: Takes ticket from available pool

### Monitoring Capacity
You can easily check ticket availability:

```sql
-- Check ticket type availability
SELECT 
    name,
    total_capacity,
    available_count,
    reserved_count,
    sold_count,
    (total_capacity - available_count - reserved_count - sold_count) as discrepancy
FROM event_tickets
WHERE event_id = 'your-event-id';
```

### Important Notes
1. **Always specify `ticket_type_id`** when creating tickets - the counts won't update without it
2. The system prevents overselling by using `GREATEST(..., 0)` to ensure counts never go negative
3. If data gets out of sync, use the recalculate functions:
   ```sql
   SELECT recalculate_event_ticket_counts();
   SELECT recalculate_event_counts();
   ```

The synchronization is now fully automated and will maintain consistency between your tables as tickets are created, updated, or deleted!
