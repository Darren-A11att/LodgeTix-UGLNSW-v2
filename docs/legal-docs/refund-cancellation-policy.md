**Effective Date: [Date]**  
**Last Updated: Sunday, 22 June 2025**  
**Version: 2.0**

## Important Notice
This Refund and Cancellation Policy explains how refunds and cancellations work on LodgeTix. **The specific refund process varies significantly depending on which payment model is used for your booking.** Please read this policy carefully and understand your rights under Australian Consumer Law.

## 1. Overview and Scope

### 1.1 Policy Authority Hierarchy
**Primary Authority - Event Organisers:**
- **Event Organisers set their own refund and cancellation policies** for each event
- These policies are displayed prominently on event listings before purchase
- Organiser policies range from "No Refunds" to "Full Refunds with conditions"
- LodgeTix enforces the Organiser's chosen policy within legal requirements

**Secondary Authority - Australian Consumer Law:**
- **Australian Consumer Law (ACL) provides minimum consumer protections** that cannot be waived
- ACL rights apply regardless of Organiser refund policies
- Event cancellations and significant changes trigger automatic ACL protections
- Unfair contract terms are void under ACL

**Platform Role - LodgeTix:**
- LodgeTix facilitates refunds but does not set individual event refund policies
- Our role varies significantly depending on the payment model used
- We provide dispute resolution assistance but cannot override legitimate Organiser policies
- We ensure compliance with Australian Consumer Law requirements

### 1.2 Three Payment Models Explained

**Critical: The payment model determines who you contact for refunds and how refunds are processed.**

#### Model 1: Display & Communicate
**What it is:** Basic service showing payment instructions only
- **Payment Method:** Direct bank transfer from you to the Event Organiser
- **LodgeTix Role:** Information display and communication facilitation only
- **Refund Contact:** Event Organiser directly
- **Refund Processor:** Event Organiser processes refunds from their own funds

#### Model 2: Direct Integration
**What it is:** Organiser uses their existing payment provider through LodgeTix platform
- **Payment Method:** Credit card, debit card, or digital wallet through Organiser's provider
- **LodgeTix Role:** Technical integration and booking management
- **Refund Contact:** Event Organiser (who contacts their payment provider)
- **Refund Processor:** Organiser's payment provider (e.g., their Stripe, Square, PayPal account)

#### Model 3: Payment Agent
**What it is:** LodgeTix acts as payment agent for Organisers without existing payment solutions
- **Payment Method:** Credit card, debit card, or digital wallet through LodgeTix systems
- **LodgeTix Role:** Payment agent collecting and holding funds on Organiser's behalf
- **Refund Contact:** LodgeTix platform (with Organiser approval required)
- **Refund Processor:** LodgeTix processes refunds from held funds

### 1.3 How to Identify Your Payment Model
Check your booking confirmation email or receipt:
- **"Pay by bank transfer to [Organiser Name]"** = Display & Communicate
- **"Processed by [Organiser Name] via [Payment Provider]"** = Direct Integration  
- **"Processed by LodgeTix as agent for [Organiser Name]"** = Payment Agent

## 2. Australian Consumer Law Requirements

### 2.1 Mandatory Consumer Protections

- **Additional compensation** may be available for consequential losses (travel, accommodation)

**Significant Event Changes:**

### 14.2 Grandfathering Provisions
**Protection for Existing Bookings:**

- **Beneficial changes:** New consumer protections may be applied retroactively
- **Event-specific policies:** Organiser policy changes don't affect existing bookings

**Important Reminder:** This policy explains LodgeTix's procedures, but **Event Organisers set their own specific refund policies for each event**. Always check the individual event's refund policy before purchasing. When in doubt about your rights, particularly regarding cancelled or significantly changed events, remember that Australian Consumer Law provides protections that cannot be waived by any policy terms.
