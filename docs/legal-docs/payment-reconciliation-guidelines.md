# Payment Reconciliation Guidelines

**Model 1: Display & Communicate**  
**Effective Date: 22 June 2025**  
**Last Updated: Sunday, 22 June 2025**

## Overview

This guide provides practical instructions for event organisers using LodgeTix's Display & Communicate payment model. In this model, you receive payments directly to your bank account and are responsible for confirming them in the system.

## How the Display & Communicate Model Works

1. **Attendee Registration**: Attendees complete registration and select their packages
2. **Payment Instructions**: LodgeTix displays your bank account details with a unique reference number
3. **Direct Payment**: Attendees transfer funds directly to your bank account
4. **Payment Confirmation**: You confirm payments received in the LodgeTix system
5. **Registration Completion**: Confirmed payments activate attendee registrations

## Confirming Payments in the System

### Daily Reconciliation Process

**Step 1: Access Your Dashboard**
- Log into your LodgeTix organiser account
- Navigate to **"Payments"** → **"Pending Confirmations"**

**Step 2: Review Bank Account**
- Check your bank account for new incoming transfers
- Look for payments with LodgeTix reference numbers in the description

**Step 3: Match Payments to Registrations**
- Compare bank transfers to pending registrations in your dashboard
- Match using:
  - Payment amount
  - Reference number (format: LTX-[EventID]-[RegistrationID])
  - Payment date
  - Attendee name (if provided by bank)

**Step 4: Confirm Payment**
- Click **"Confirm Payment"** next to the matching registration
- Enter the required information (see Required Information section below)
- Save confirmation

### Required Information for Confirmation

When confirming a payment, you must provide:

- **Payment Date**: The date the transfer appeared in your account
- **Amount Received**: The exact amount received (may differ from expected due to fees)
- **Bank Reference**: The transaction reference from your bank statement
- **Additional Notes**: Any relevant details about the payment

### Bulk Confirmation Process

For multiple payments:

1. **Export Pending List**: Download CSV of pending payments
2. **Match with Bank Statement**: Cross-reference with your bank's transaction export
3. **Upload Confirmation File**: Use LodgeTix bulk upload feature
4. **Review and Approve**: Check matches before final confirmation

## Matching Payments to Registrations

### Primary Matching Methods

**1. Reference Number Matching**
- Look for reference format: LTX-[EventID]-[RegistrationID]
- This is the most reliable matching method
- Contact attendees if reference is missing or incorrect

**2. Amount and Date Matching**
- Match payment amount to registration total
- Consider the payment date range (±2 days typical)
- Use when reference numbers are unclear

**3. Name Matching**
- Match bank transfer sender name to registration name
- Be cautious - names may vary (business vs. personal accounts)
- Use as supporting evidence only

### When Matching Is Difficult

If you cannot match a payment:
1. Check for partial reference numbers
2. Contact the attendee directly
3. Ask for transaction receipt or confirmation
4. Use payment amount and timing to make reasonable matches
5. Document any assumptions made

## Handling Partial Payments

### When Payments Are Less Than Expected

**Step 1: Record Actual Amount**
- Confirm the partial payment amount received
- Update the registration status to "Partial Payment"

**Step 2: Calculate Outstanding Balance**
- System will automatically calculate remaining amount
- Set follow-up reminder for outstanding balance

**Step 3: Contact Attendee**
- Send friendly reminder about outstanding balance
- Provide payment instructions for remaining amount
- Set reasonable deadline for completion

**Step 4: Follow-Up Process**
- Send reminder 3 days before event (if applicable)
- Consider partial attendance options
- Document all communication

### Common Reasons for Partial Payments

- Bank transfer fees deducted from payment
- International currency conversion differences
- Attendee mathematical error
- Intentional partial payment pending approval

## Dealing with Overpayments

### When Payments Exceed Expected Amount

**Step 1: Confirm Full Payment**
- Record the full amount received
- Mark registration as "Overpaid"

**Step 2: Calculate Overpayment**
- System calculates excess amount
- Consider if overpayment covers additional services/donations

**Step 3: Contact Attendee**
- Notify attendee of overpayment within 48 hours
- Offer options:
  - Refund excess amount
  - Credit towards additional services
  - Donate excess to event/organisation
  - Hold credit for future events

**Step 4: Process Resolution**
- Document attendee's preferred resolution
- Process refund if requested (see Refund section)
- Update registration notes

## Managing Refunds
