## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas
1. **Database Migrations (IF-003)**
   - Risk: Data loss or corruption
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive backup strategy, staged rollout

2. **Environment Configuration (IF-001)**
   - Risk: Service disruption from missing config
   - Mitigation: Validation checks, gradual rollout

3. **Feature Flag Implementation (IF-002)**
   - Risk: Inconsistent user experience
   - Mitigation: Percentage-based rollout, monitoring

### Rollback Procedures
Every task includes:
- Immediate rollback strategy (< 5 minutes)
- Extended rollback procedure (> 5 minutes)
- Data recovery options
- Communication plan

## Success Metrics
