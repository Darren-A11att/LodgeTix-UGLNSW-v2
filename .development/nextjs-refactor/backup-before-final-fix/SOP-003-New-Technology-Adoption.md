# SOP-003: New Technology Adoption

## Purpose
This SOP defines the process for evaluating and adopting new technologies, libraries, or tools in the project while ensuring they align with our immutable laws.

## Scope
This applies to:
- New npm packages/libraries
- Framework upgrades
- Development tools
- Build process changes
- Third-party services

## Process

### Step 1: Technology Evaluation

#### 1.1 Initial Assessment
Complete the evaluation form:
```markdown
Technology: [Name]
Purpose: [What problem it solves]
Category: [ ] Library [ ] Tool [ ] Service [ ] Framework
License: [License type]
Maintenance: [ ] Active [ ] Stable [ ] Abandoned
Community: [ ] Large [ ] Medium [ ] Small
```

#### 1.2 Research Official Documentation
Conduct thorough research:
- [ ] Official documentation site
- [ ] Best practices guide
- [ ] Migration guides
- [ ] Known issues/limitations
- [ ] Community patterns
- [ ] Example implementations

Document findings:
```markdown
## Research Summary
Documentation URL: [Link]
Version researched: [X.X.X]
Key patterns identified:
1. [Pattern 1]
2. [Pattern 2]
3. [Pattern 3]

Potential law impacts:
- [Law X]: [Impact description]
- [Law Y]: [Impact description]
```

#### 1.3 Best Practices Analysis
Review and document:
- [ ] Recommended patterns from docs
- [ ] Anti-patterns to avoid
- [ ] Performance considerations
- [ ] Security implications
- [ ] Testing strategies
- [ ] Common pitfalls

Create summary:
```markdown
## Best Practices Found
### DO:
- [Best practice 1]
- [Best practice 2]

### DON'T:
- [Anti-pattern 1]
- [Anti-pattern 2]

### Law Implications:
- May require new law for [topic]
- Conflicts with Law [X] regarding [topic]
- Enhances Law [Y] by [improvement]
```

#### 1.4 Law Compatibility Check
Review against each law:
- [ ] Law 1: Server Components - Compatible?
- [ ] Law 2: File-based Routing - Impact?
- [ ] Law 3: Co-location - Changes needed?
- [ ] Law 4: Conventions - New conventions?
- [ ] Law 5: Type Safety - TypeScript support?
- [ ] Law 6: Data Fetching - Affects patterns?
- [ ] Law 7: Separation - Architectural fit?
- [ ] Law 8: Progressive Enhancement - Client impact?
- [ ] Law 9: Performance - Bundle size impact?
- [ ] Law 10: Consistency - Team adoption?
- [ ] Law 11: File Extensions - New file types?
- [ ] Law 12: TypeScript - Type definitions?
- [ ] Law 13: Law Creation - Need new laws?

### Step 2: Proof of Concept

#### 2.1 Isolated Testing
Create POC branch:
```bash
git checkout -b poc/[technology-name]
mkdir .poc/[technology-name]
```

#### 2.2 Integration Testing
Test with:
- [ ] Basic implementation
- [ ] Type safety verification
- [ ] Performance benchmarking
- [ ] Build process compatibility
- [ ] Testing framework integration

### Step 3: Impact Analysis

#### 3.1 Code Impact
Document required changes:
```markdown
## Code Changes Required
- [ ] Configuration files
- [ ] Build process
- [ ] Type definitions
- [ ] Test setup
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline
```

#### 3.2 Performance Impact
Measure:
- Bundle size before: [XX]KB
- Bundle size after: [XX]KB
- Build time impact: [+/-X]s
- Runtime performance: [Metrics]

### Step 4: Team Review

#### 4.1 Proposal Document
Create proposal including:
1. Problem statement
2. Solution comparison
3. POC results
4. Migration plan
5. Rollback strategy

#### 4.2 Review Meeting
Agenda:
1. Demo POC
2. Discuss impacts
3. Vote on adoption
4. Set conditions

### Step 5: Adoption Decision

#### 5.1 Decision Criteria
Must meet ALL:
- [ ] Solves identified problem
- [ ] Compatible with laws
- [ ] Acceptable performance
- [ ] Team consensus
- [ ] Maintenance commitment

#### 5.2 Decision Documentation
```markdown
Decision: [ ] Adopt [ ] Reject [ ] Defer
Conditions: [Any conditions]
Timeline: [Implementation timeline]
Owner: [Responsible person]
```

### Step 6: Implementation

#### 6.1 Law Updates
If laws need updating:
1. Follow SOP-001 for law creation
2. Update patterns documentation
3. Create migration guide

#### 6.2 Rollout Plan
Phases:
1. Update documentation
2. Team training
3. Pilot implementation
4. Full rollout
5. Legacy cleanup

## Example: Adopting tRPC

### Evaluation
```markdown
Technology: tRPC
Purpose: Type-safe API calls
Category: [x] Library
License: MIT
Maintenance: [x] Active
```

### Law Compatibility
- Law 1: ‚úì Works with server components
- Law 5: ‚úì Enhances type safety
- Law 6: ‚ö†Ô∏è Changes data fetching patterns

### Decision
Adopt with conditions:
- Create new data fetching patterns
- Update Law 6 documentation
- Gradual migration plan

## Templates

### Technology Proposal Template
