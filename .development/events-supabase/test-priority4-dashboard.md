# Test Results: Priority 4 - Organizer Dashboard

## Page: `/app/organizer/dashboard/page.tsx`

### Changes Made:
1. ✅ Created server-side wrapper component
2. ✅ Moved client component to `client.tsx`
3. ✅ Added `getEvents` import from facade in wrapper
4. ✅ Pass events as props to client component
5. ✅ Client component receives events instead of using hard-coded data

### Strategy:
Since the dashboard is a complex client component with state management, we used a wrapper pattern:
- `page.tsx`: Server component that fetches events
- `client.tsx`: Client component that receives events as props

### Expected Behavior:
- Dashboard shows events from Supabase when feature flag is enabled
- Shows hard-coded events when feature flag is disabled
- All interactive features remain functional

### Test URLs:
- http://localhost:3000/organizer/dashboard
- Should see real events listed in the dashboard

### Status: ✅ COMPLETE

### Potential Issues to Watch:
- Date formatting may need adjustment
- Revenue formatting (currently uses $ prefix)
- Status might need mapping

### Next Steps:
1. Test the dashboard to ensure events display correctly
2. Check that all tabs work properly
3. Move to final testing phase
