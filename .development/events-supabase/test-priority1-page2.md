# Test Results: Priority 1 Page 2 - Confirmation Page

## Page: `/app/events/[id]/confirmation/page.tsx`

### Changes Made:
1. ✅ Added imports for `notFound` and `getEventById` from event facade
2. ✅ Replaced hard-coded `getEventDetails` with `getEventById` from facade
3. ✅ Split data into event (from facade) and order details (mock data)
4. ✅ Updated all references to use correct data sources
5. ✅ Added proper error handling with `notFound()`
6. ✅ Fixed event link to use slug when available

### Expected Behavior:
- Page fetches event from facade based on ID
- Order details are mocked (would normally come from a database)
- Shows confirmation with event info and order details
- Links back to event page using slug

### Test URLs:
- http://localhost:3000/events/grand-installation-2025/confirmation
- http://localhost:3000/events/d290f1ee-6c54-4b01-90e6-d701748f0854/confirmation

### Status: ✅ READY FOR TESTING

### Potential Issues to Watch:
- Mock order data doesn't match actual tickets
- Date/time formatting may need adjustment
- Should eventually integrate with real order data

### Next Steps:
1. Test the page manually in browser
2. Verify event data loads correctly
3. Check confirmation displays properly
4. Test navigation back to event page
