# Test Results: Priority 2 - Ticket Components

## Component 1: `/app/events/[id]/tickets/components/order-summary.tsx`

### Current Status:
- ✅ Already using `getEventByIdOrSlug` from event facade
- ✅ Correctly fetches event data asynchronously
- ✅ Uses Ticket type from event-utils (which is correct)

### Analysis:
This component is already properly integrated with the event facade. No changes needed.

## Component 2: `/app/events/[id]/tickets/components/ticket-selection.tsx`

### Current Status:
- ✅ Receives tickets as props from parent
- ✅ Uses Ticket type from event-utils (which is correct)
- ✅ No direct event fetching - properly decoupled

### Analysis:
This component follows the correct pattern of receiving data as props. No changes needed.

## Summary

Both ticket components are already correctly implemented:
1. `OrderSummary` fetches from the facade
2. `TicketSelection` receives data as props
3. Both use the correct Ticket type

The original plan assumed these components needed updates, but they're already following best practices for the facade pattern.
