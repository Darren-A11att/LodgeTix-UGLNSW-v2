# Test Results: Priority 1 Page 1 - Tickets Page

## Page: `/app/events/[id]/tickets/page.tsx`

### Changes Made:
1. ✅ Replaced `import { getEventByIdOrSlug } from "@/lib/services/event-service"` with `import { getEventById } from "@/lib/event-facade"`
2. ✅ Updated function call from `getEventByIdOrSlug(id)` to `getEventById(id)`
3. ✅ Added `getEventById` method to the event facade

### Expected Behavior:
- When feature flag is enabled (`NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_EVENTS_SCHEMA=true`), events load from Supabase
- When feature flag is disabled, events load from hard-coded data
- Page should show event details and ticket selection

### Test URLs:
- http://localhost:3000/events/grand-installation-2025/tickets
- http://localhost:3000/events/d290f1ee-6c54-4b01-90e6-d701748f0854/tickets

### Status: ✅ READY FOR TESTING

### Potential Issues to Watch:
- Event.tickets property should be populated
- Date formatting should work correctly
- Order flow should continue to work

### Next Steps:
1. Test the page manually in browser
2. Verify event data loads correctly
3. Test ticket selection functionality
4. Check for console errors
