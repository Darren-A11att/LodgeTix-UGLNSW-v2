## 1. Project Structure and Architecture

### 1.1 Overview
The LodgeTix-UGLNSW-v2 project is built using Next.js 15 with the App Router pattern, employing modern React practices and a well-organized component structure. The application is designed for event registration and ticket management for Masonic events, featuring a multi-step wizard registration process.

### 1.2 Architecture Patterns

#### Next.js App Structure
- **App Router**: Uses the `/app` directory for file-based routing with specialized files like `page.tsx`, `layout.tsx`, and `loading.tsx`
- **Route Organization**: Routes are logically structured under directories like `/events/[id]` for dynamic event pages
- **API Routes**: API endpoints are implemented in the `/app/api` directory following the `/api/route.ts` pattern

#### Component Organization
- **UI Components**: Generic UI components in `/components/ui` (shadcn-based)
- **Feature Components**: Domain-specific components in `/components/registration`
- **Composition Pattern**: Complex interfaces are built from smaller, specialized components

### 1.3 Main Functionality Patterns

#### Events System
- Dynamic routes for individual event pages
- Special handling for the "Grand Installation" event
- Organizer features for event creation and management

#### Registration Workflow
- Multi-step wizard implemented as a progressive form flow
- Form management with React Hook Form and Zod validation
- Complex data structures for different attendee types

#### Payment Integration
- Stripe Elements integration for secure payment processing
- Server-side payment intent creation
- Client-side payment submission and confirmation

### 1.4 Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, React 19
- **UI Components**: Radix UI, shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: Zustand with persist middleware
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form, Zod
- **Data Storage**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Payment Processing**: Stripe

### 1.5 Strengths
- Clear separation of concerns between UI components and business logic
- Well-organized file structure following Next.js conventions
- Modular component design facilitating reusability
- Strong typing throughout the application

### 1.6 Areas for Improvement
- Overuse of client-side components, missing opportunities for server components
- Some inconsistent file organization in specific feature areas
- Limited code splitting for optimized loading
- Incomplete architecture documentation

## 2. Security Assessment

### 2.1 Authentication Implementation

**Findings:**
- Authentication appears to be simulated, not fully implemented
- No proper token management or authentication middleware
- Missing password strength validation
- No CSRF protection for authentication forms

**Recommendations:**
- Implement proper authentication using NextAuth.js or JWT-based solution
- Add password strength requirements and validation
- Implement CSRF protection for all forms
- Add rate limiting for login attempts
- Create proper authentication middleware to protect private routes

### 2.2 API Routes Security

**Findings:**
- Basic input validation in the Stripe payment API route
- Sensitive data like client secrets are logged to console
- Missing CORS configuration for API endpoints
- No rate limiting to prevent abuse

**Recommendations:**
- Add server-side validation of payment amounts against order data
- Implement proper CORS restrictions
- Remove or redact sensitive information from logs
- Add signature verification for webhooks
- Implement API rate limiting and authorization checks

### 2.3 Input Validation & Sanitization

**Findings:**
- Inconsistent validation across form components
- Client-side only validation in some components
- Missing protection against common attack vectors like XSS

**Recommendations:**
- Apply Zod validation consistently across all form components
- Implement server-side validation for form submissions
- Add input sanitization to prevent XSS attacks
- Implement Content Security Policy headers

### 2.4 Payment Processing Security

**Findings:**
- Proper use of Stripe Elements for secure card handling
- Missing server-side validation of payment amounts
- Adequate error handling for payment failures

**Recommendations:**
- Implement idempotency keys for payment requests
- Add webhook validation with signature verification
- Improve error messaging without revealing sensitive details
- Add fraud detection measures

### 2.5 Critical Security Issues
1. **Missing Authentication**: Only simulated login functionality
2. **Insufficient Server-Side Validation**: Many operations rely only on client-side validation
3. **Sensitive Data Exposure**: Through logging and client-side storage
4. **Limited API Protections**: Missing CORS, rate limiting, and authorization
5. **Inconsistent Form Validation**: Varying approaches across components

## 3. Data Handling and Privacy

### 3.1 User Data Collection and Storage

**Client-Side Data Management:**
- Zustand store with persist middleware stores registration data in localStorage
- Well-structured data models with clear type definitions
- UUID generation for tracking registrations

**Database Structure:**
- Supabase with organized schema for persistent storage
- Row-Level Security implementation on some tables
- Proper relationships between entities

### 3.2 Privacy Considerations

**User Information Collection:**
- Extensive personal information collection during registration
- Contact preference settings to specify communication preferences
- Missing explicit opt-in/opt-out mechanisms for marketing

**User Consent:**
- Database includes `agreeToTerms` field, but consent capture process is unclear
- No visible privacy policy or terms of service presentation

### 3.3 Handling of Sensitive Information

**Payment Data:**
- PCI-compliant Stripe integration
- Avoids storing complete card details client-side
- Proper handling of billing information

**Personal Information:**
- Collection of personal and Masonic membership details
- No visible encryption or masking of PII
- Some debugging logs may expose sensitive data

### 3.4 Areas for Improvement

1. **Sensitive Data in localStorage**: Consider sessionStorage for ephemeral storage
2. **PII Protection**: Implement encryption or tokenization for sensitive fields
3. **Privacy Controls**: Add user controls for data access and deletion
4. **Consent Management**: Implement explicit privacy policy consent
5. **Data Retention Policy**: Define and implement data expiration strategy

## 4. Performance Optimization

### 4.1 Component Optimization

**State Management:**
- Zustand provides performance benefits over Context API
- Selective subscription capabilities not fully utilized
- Debug logs should be removed in production

**Memoization and Code Splitting:**
- Limited use of React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback
- No explicit code splitting or lazy loading
- Registration wizard steps could benefit from splitting

### 4.2 Next.js-Specific Optimizations

**Server vs. Client Components:**
- All examined components are client components
- Missing server component opportunities for reduced JavaScript payload
- Event details pages could be server-rendered for faster initial load

**Image Optimization:**
- Next.js config has image optimization disabled
- Missing responsive images and modern formats
- No placeholder or blur strategies for loading

### 4.3 Loading States and User Feedback

**Global Loading:**
- Next.js loading.tsx exists but returns null
- Missing route-based loading indicators

**Component-Level Loading:**
- Good loading state in payment processing
- Missing indicators in many other async operations
- No skeleton loaders or content placeholders

### 4.4 Critical Performance Issues

1. **Disabled TypeScript and ESLint Checks**: Bypasses error prevention
2. **Console Logging in Production**: Impacts performance
3. **Missing Web Vitals Monitoring**: No performance tracking
4. **Disabled Image Optimization**: Missing core Next.js performance feature
5. **No Code Splitting**: Larger initial bundle size

### 4.5 Recommendations

**Short-term:**
- Enable Next.js image optimization
- Implement proper loading indicators
