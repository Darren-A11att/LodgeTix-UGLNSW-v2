- Implemented Playwright bridge for compatibility

### Phase 4: Self-Healing âœ…
- Implemented comprehensive self-healing framework
- Created 6 healing strategies:
  - ID matching
  - Data-testid lookup
  - CSS alternatives
  - XPath fallbacks
  - Text content search
  - Visual similarity (placeholder)
- Built selector mapping utility
- Added healing history tracking

### Phase 5: CI/CD Integration âœ…
- Created GitHub Actions workflows:
  - `e2e-tests.yml`: Parallel Playwright + Puppeteer execution
  - `claude-test-generation.yml`: Automated test generation
- Implemented test data management with Supabase
- Added automatic cleanup procedures
- Set up non-blocking initial integration

### Phase 6: Monitoring Dashboard âœ…
- Built Express-based monitoring dashboard
- Created real-time test status monitoring
- Implemented coverage comparison charts
- Added self-healing activity tracking
- Generated actionable recommendations

### Phase 7: Team Training âœ…
- Created comprehensive training guide
- Developed troubleshooting documentation
- Built Claude Code command templates
- Prepared migration strategy document
