# Puppeteer E2E Test Results Report

## Test Environment
- **Application URL**: http://192.168.20.41:3000
- **Test Framework**: Puppeteer with Self-Healing
- **Date**: ${new Date().toISOString()}

## Summary

### ‚úÖ Successful Implementations
1. **Test Configuration Updated**: Successfully configured tests to use the correct application URL
2. **Missing Dependencies Fixed**: Created `test-data.js` and `test-utils.js` files  
3. **Self-Healing Framework**: Confirmed self-healing framework is properly integrated with Claude Code MCP
4. **Application Navigation**: Successfully navigated to the application and event pages

### üîç Key Findings

#### Application Behavior
1. **Event Slug**: The application uses `grand-proclamation-2025` as the event slug
2. **Registration Flow**: 
   - Clicking on event navigates directly to registration page with a unique UUID
   - Registration wizard has 6 steps: Registration Type ‚Üí Attendee Details ‚Üí Select Tickets ‚Üí Review Order ‚Üí Payment ‚Üí Confirmation
3. **UI Elements**:
   - Registration type selection uses card-based UI without visible Select buttons in initial view
   - Three registration types available: Myself & Others, Lodge Registration, Official Delegation

#### Test Challenges
1. **Selector Mismatches**: Tests were written for different UI elements than what exists in the application
2. **Navigation Flow**: Tests expected intermediate pages that don't exist in current flow
3. **Element Visibility**: Some interactive elements may require hover or different viewport sizes

### üìä Test Results

| Test Suite | Status | Issues |
|------------|--------|---------|
| Setup Verification | ‚úÖ Passed | None |
| Registration Workflow | ‚ùå Failed | Selector mismatches, navigation differences |
| Individual Mason Variations | ‚ùå Failed | Missing test dependencies (fixed) |
| Other E2E Tests | ‚ùå Failed | Similar selector and flow issues |

## Recommendations

### 1. Update Test Selectors
The tests need to be updated to match the actual UI implementation:
- Use more flexible selectors that work with card-based layouts
- Implement hover actions where needed
- Update expected navigation flows

### 2. Enhance Self-Healing
- Add visual recognition strategies for card-based UIs
- Implement smart waiting for dynamic content
- Add fallback strategies for different UI states

### 3. Test Data Alignment
- Verify all test data matches current database schema
- Update event slugs and URLs in test configuration
- Ensure test users have proper permissions

## Self-Healing Integration with Claude Code MCP

The self-healing framework successfully integrates with Claude Code through:

1. **Automatic Selector Recovery**: When selectors fail, the framework tries multiple strategies
2. **Visual Matching**: Can identify elements by visual appearance when other methods fail
3. **Learning from Failures**: Stores successful healing patterns for future use
4. **Claude Code Integration**: Can request assistance from Claude for complex healing scenarios

### Healing Strategies Available:
- ID-based selection
- Data-testid attributes
- CSS selectors
- XPath queries
- Text content matching
- Visual recognition

## Next Steps

1. **Update Test Suite**: Modify all tests to work with current UI implementation
2. **Implement Missing Test IDs**: Add data-testid attributes to key UI elements
3. **Create Visual Baselines**: Capture baseline screenshots for visual regression testing
4. **Run Full Suite**: Execute complete test suite with updated selectors
5. **Monitor Self-Healing**: Track which selectors require healing most often

## Running the Tests

To run the tests with self-healing enabled:

```bash
cd tests/puppeteer

# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific category
npm test -- --testPathPattern=e2e

# Run with visible browser
PUPPETEER_HEADLESS=false npm test

# Run single test file
npm test -- specs/e2e/registration-workflow.spec.js
```

## Conclusion

The Puppeteer test infrastructure is properly set up with self-healing capabilities. The main challenge is updating the test cases to match the current application implementation. With the self-healing framework in place, tests can automatically adapt to minor UI changes, reducing maintenance overhead.
