## Route Trace Verification Log

### Files Verified Safe to Delete
- [ ] (Verified files will be listed here after manual checks)

### Files to Keep
- [ ] (Files that should be kept will be listed here after manual checks)

## Action Plan

1. **Immediate Actions (High Confidence)**:
   - Delete all .bak, .backup files
   - Remove completed migration scripts
   - Delete example/test components

2. **Requires Verification (Medium Confidence)**:
   - Check if *Updated.tsx components are replacements
   - Verify hero/marketing components aren't used on any pages
   - Test if removing services breaks anything

3. **Careful Review (Low Confidence)**:
   - Keep Next.js special files unless confirmed unused
   - Keep shadcn/ui components for potential future use
   - Review type files for documentation value

## Notes
- Total potential space savings: ~168 files
- Many UI components are from shadcn/ui library (standard installation)
- Migration scripts from May 2025 have been executed and can be archived
- Backup files (.bak, .old, .backup) should always be deleted
