  // MASONIC EVENT REGISTRATION
  {
    id: "masonic-registration-process",
    question: "How do I register for a Masonic event on LodgeTix?",
    answer: "Registration for Masonic events is designed to be straightforward whilst maintaining proper protocols. First, create your Masonic profile by providing your Lodge affiliation, Grand Lodge jurisdiction, and current membership status. Once verified, you can browse available events and select tickets appropriate to your membership level. The platform automatically checks your eligibility for restricted events such as installation ceremonies or degree-specific functions. After selecting your tickets, complete the secure payment process and receive instant confirmation with QR codes for easy check-in."
  },
  {
    id: "verification-requirements",
    question: "What verification is required for Masonic event registration?",
    answer: "LodgeTix requires accurate Masonic credentials to ensure event eligibility and maintain fraternal standards. You'll need to provide your current Lodge name and number, Grand Lodge jurisdiction, membership status, and any relevant offices held. For installation ceremonies and degree-specific events, additional verification may be required to confirm your eligibility to attend. Our system cross-references your information with our comprehensive database of recognised Grand Lodge jurisdictions worldwide. If additional verification is needed, our support team will contact you directly."
  },
  {
    id: "guest-policies",
    question: "Can I bring guests to Masonic events, and what are the policies?",
    answer: "Guest policies vary depending on the specific event and its ceremonial requirements. Social events and festive boards typically welcome partners and family members, whilst installation ceremonies and Lodge meetings are generally restricted to qualified Brethren. When registering, the event description will clearly indicate guest eligibility and any restrictions. For events that permit guests, you can add them during registration by providing their details and relationship to you. Please note that some jurisdictions may have specific guest protocols, and event organisers reserve the right to approve guest attendance."

  // MEMBERSHIP & CREDENTIALS
  {
    id: "lodge-verification",
    question: "How does LodgeTix verify my Lodge membership?",
    answer: "Our verification system maintains a comprehensive database of recognised Grand Lodge jurisdictions and their constituent Lodges. When you create your profile, we validate your Lodge details against this database, which includes over 200 Grand Lodge jurisdictions worldwide. For most established Lodges, verification is automatic. If your Lodge is not immediately recognised, our team will manually verify your membership within 24 hours. This process ensures that only genuine Brethren can access appropriate events whilst respecting the autonomous nature of different Masonic jurisdictions."
  },
  {
    id: "visiting-mason-protocols",
    question: "I'm a visiting Mason from another jurisdiction. How do I register for events?",
    answer: "LodgeTix warmly welcomes visiting Brethren from recognised Grand Lodge jurisdictions. During registration, simply select your home Grand Lodge and provide your Lodge details. Our system automatically validates recognition between jurisdictions based on established fraternal relationships. If you're from a jurisdiction not immediately recognised, please contact our support team with your credentials, and we'll verify your membership manually. We understand the importance of fraternal visitation and work to ensure all qualified Brethren can participate in appropriate events regardless of their home jurisdiction."
  },
  {
    id: "grand-lodge-recognition",
    question: "What if my Grand Lodge isn't listed in your system?",
    answer: "Our database includes all major recognised Grand Lodge jurisdictions, but we acknowledge that Masonic recognition can be complex and evolving. If your Grand Lodge isn't listed, please contact our support team with details of your jurisdiction, including your Grand Lodge's official name, location, and any recognition documentation you can provide. We work closely with the United Grand Lodge of NSW & ACT to verify recognition status and will update our system accordingly. In the interim, we can manually verify your membership to ensure you don't miss important events."

  // EVENT TYPES & REQUIREMENTS
  {
    id: "dress-codes-ceremony-requirements",
    question: "What are the dress code requirements for different types of Masonic events?",
    answer: "Dress codes vary according to the nature and formality of each event, respecting traditional Masonic protocols. Installation ceremonies typically require dark business attire or formal evening wear, with Masonic regalia as appropriate to your rank and office. Social events and festive boards may specify cocktail attire or smart casual dress. Educational presentations often welcome business casual attire. Each event listing clearly specifies the expected dress code, and when in doubt, business attire is always appropriate. We recommend checking the event details carefully, as some ceremonies may have specific requirements regarding regalia, jewels, or ceremonial items."
  },
  {
    id: "ceremony-types-eligibility",
    question: "What types of Masonic ceremonies can I attend, and how is eligibility determined?",
    answer: "Eligibility for Masonic ceremonies depends on your membership status, degree level, and the specific requirements of each event. Installation ceremonies are typically open to all Master Masons in good standing, whilst certain degree ceremonies may have specific eligibility requirements. Educational presentations and social events usually welcome all Brethren and their families. Lodge meetings are generally restricted to members of that Lodge and qualified visitors. Our platform automatically checks your eligibility based on your profile information and the event's requirements. If you're unsure about your eligibility for a specific event, the platform will guide you or connect you with the event organisers."
  },
  {
    id: "multi-day-conference-requirements",
    question: "How do I register for multi-day Masonic conferences and what should I expect?",
    answer: "Multi-day conferences require careful planning to ensure you can participate fully in all aspects of the event. When registering, you'll see package options that may include accommodation, meals, and access to various sessions. Consider which sessions align with your interests and schedule constraints. Conference packages often include opening and closing ceremonies, educational presentations, workshops, and social events. Some sessions may have prerequisite requirements or be targeted at specific audiences (such as Lodge officers or new members). Review the detailed programme before registration to ensure you select the most appropriate package for your needs and Masonic journey."

  // ACCOUNT & PROFILE MANAGEMENT
  {
    id: "masonic-profile-setup",
    question: "How do I set up my complete Masonic profile on LodgeTix?",
    answer: "Creating a comprehensive Masonic profile ensures accurate event eligibility and streamlined future registrations. Start by providing your basic membership information: current Lodge name and number, Grand Lodge jurisdiction, year of initiation, and current membership status. Add any offices you hold or have held, such as Worshipful Master, Warden positions, or committee roles. Include relevant qualifications, such as degrees attained and any specialised Masonic education. You can also specify dietary requirements, accessibility needs, and contact preferences. This information is securely stored and used solely for event management and communication purposes, in accordance with Masonic confidentiality principles."
  },
  {
    id: "lodge-affiliation-updates",
    question: "I've moved to a new Lodge or changed jurisdictions. How do I update my profile?",
    answer: "Updating your Lodge affiliation is straightforward and important for maintaining accurate records. Access your profile settings and select 'Edit Masonic Information.' Update your new Lodge name and number, and if you've changed jurisdictions, select your new Grand Lodge from our comprehensive list. If you maintain membership in multiple Lodges, you can add these as additional affiliations. Please note that changes to your primary Lodge affiliation may affect your eligibility for certain Lodge-specific events. Our system will automatically update your access permissions based on your new affiliation details."

  // PAYMENT & TICKETING
  {
    id: "payment-methods-security",
    question: "What payment methods are accepted, and how secure is the payment process?",
    answer: "LodgeTix accepts all major credit cards, debit cards, and digital wallet payments through our secure payment partner, Stripe. All transactions are processed using bank-level encryption and comply with PCI DSS standards for payment security. We never store your complete payment information on our servers. For Lodge events, payments are processed directly to the Lodge's nominated account via Stripe Connect, ensuring transparent financial management. You'll receive immediate confirmation of successful payments, and all transaction records are available in your account history for expense tracking and reimbursement purposes."
  },
  {
    id: "ticket-transfers-sharing",
    question: "Can I transfer my tickets to another Brother or change the attendee details?",
    answer: "Ticket transfers are possible for most social events and general Masonic functions, subject to the event organiser's approval and the transferee's eligibility. For installation ceremonies and degree-specific events, transfers may be restricted due to eligibility requirements. To transfer a ticket, access your registration in 'My Events' and select the transfer option. You'll need to provide the new attendee's Masonic credentials for verification. Both parties will receive confirmation of the transfer. Please note that some events may have transfer deadlines or fees. For significant changes or special circumstances, contact our support team for assistance."
  },
  {
    id: "refund-policies-cancellation",
    question: "What is the refund policy if I need to cancel my registration?",
    answer: "Refund policies reflect the planning requirements of Masonic events whilst showing understanding for unavoidable circumstances. Generally, cancellations made more than 14 days before the event receive a full refund minus processing fees. Cancellations within 7-14 days typically receive a 50% refund, whilst cancellations within 7 days may not be eligible for refunds due to catering and venue commitments. Emergency circumstances such as illness or family bereavement are considered individually with compassion. Each event may have specific cancellation terms, which are clearly stated during registration. Lodge organisers may offer credit towards future events in lieu of refunds where appropriate."

You can manage attendee lists, send communications, process refunds, and generate reports for Lodge records. Financial reporting shows real-time revenue and attendee analytics.

Message templates are available for common communications like event reminders, venue changes, or protocol updates. The system maintains complete communication logs for Lodge records. Member information is presented in a format suitable for ceremonial seating plans and catering requirements, whilst maintaining appropriate privacy controls. Attendee lists can be exported for Lodge use whilst ensuring compliance with privacy regulations. All communications are branded appropriately and maintain the dignity expected of Masonic correspondence."
