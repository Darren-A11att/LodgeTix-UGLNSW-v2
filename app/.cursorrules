# App Directory Rules

## Route Organization
- Group related routes using (folder) syntax
- Never create custom routing logic
- Follow Next.js conventions strictly

## Component Hierarchy
```
app/
  (customer)/     # Public routes
  (admin)/        # Protected routes  
  (auth)/         # Auth routes
  _components/    # Shared components
```

## Data Fetching Rules
- Fetch data in page.tsx or layout.tsx
- Pass data down as props
- Never fetch in client components
- Use server actions for mutations

## Performance Requirements
- Static generation by default
- Dynamic rendering only when necessary
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Monitor Core Web Vitals
